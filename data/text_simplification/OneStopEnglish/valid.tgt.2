The team, led by Professor Carlo Leifert, concludes that there are statistically signi cant differences, with a range of antioxidants being substantially higher  between 19% and 69%  in organic food.
It is the  rst study to demonstrate clear differences between organic and conventional fruits, vegetables and cereals.
The researchers say the increased levels of antioxidants are equivalent to one to two of the  ve portions of fruits and vegetables recommended to be consumed daily and would therefore be signi cant in terms of human nutrition.
The  ndings will add to the controversy over organic food and whether it is better for people.
He added, Leifert has had a lot of disagreements with a lot of people.
The results of the research are based on an analysis of 343 studies from around the world  more than ever before  which examine differences between organic and conventional fruit, vegetables and cereals.
Also, the higher levels of cadmium and pesticides in conventional produce were still far below recommended limits.
A further criticism of the research is that the differences seen may result from different climates, soil types and crop varieties, and not from organic farming.
The greatest criticism, however, will be over the suggestions of possible health bene ts.
The most recent major analysis, which included 223 studies in 2012, found little evidence.
This was also the conclusion of earlier, smaller studies published in 2009 in a scienti c journal and by the UK Food Standards Agency.
Opinion polls show healthy eating (55%) and avoiding chemical residues (53%) are key reasons given by shoppers for buying organic produce.
Browning said: This research con rms what people think about organic food.
In other countries, there have, for a long time, been much higher levels of support and acceptance of the bene ts of organic food and farming.
To a traditional navigator like Tua Pittman from Raratonga in the Cook Islands, a canoe is much more than just a means of transport.
The canoe is our island, the crew members are the community and the navigator is the leader, Pittman says.
He continues, On a canoe, you are not just going from one destination to another using the stars, the moon, the sun and the birds.
It has been a busy week for the crews of four sailing canoes since arriving in Sydney for the start of the World Parks Congress.
Around 100 crew members were involved in the voyage and they aimed to travel using only traditional navigation techniques.
Unfortunately, said Tua, the crews had to rely on modern navigation equipment at times to reach Australia in time for the Congress.
It is a partnership between the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Oceania Regional Of ce and  ve Paci c Island countries: Samoa, Tonga, New Zealand, the Cook Islands and Fiji.
Our coral reefs, the greatest in the world and our spawning grounds are disappearing.
Growing global populations and unsustainable development are reducing the ability of our ocean to sustain life.
According to the IUCN, in 2013, the amount of the worlds oceans in marine protected areas was not even three per cent and less than one per cent of that is no take (no  shing).
This was despite a target of 20-30% no-take areas set by the last World Parks Congress in 2003.
Marine scientist Professor Callum Roberts was one of the scientists who helped set the 20-30% target in 2003.
After dif cult negotiations, the World Parks Congress delegates passed a motion that will dramatically change the goals for global marine management.
Its a huge reward for all the effort that we made to be here and to be heard.
He also said that pollution was getting worse, particularly as the canoes approached big cities such as Sydney.
And climate change is already beginning to have a serious effect on Paci c Islanders.
The decisions of the big countries impact on the small countries twice, three times, four times more than they impact on developed, large nations.
PizzaExpress branches are to be targeted by protesters, in an attempt to get the restaurant chain to stop taking a proportion of tips for staff that have been paid on credit and debit cards.
Campaigners have also started an online petition in the hope that restaurant-goers will support their demands.
PizzaExpress keeps, as an admin fee, 8p out of every 1 paid when tips are given by card.
The chain, which has 430 branches around the UK and is particularly popular with families, makes around 1m a year from the practice, according to the union Unite.
We believe this 8% fee is unfair and that, if the chain values its staff, it should be paying them the total tips they are given by customers, said Chantal Chegrinec of Unite.
We are starting with PizzaExpress but they are not the only ones and we will turn our attention to other companies after this.
The  rst is taking place at the British Museum branch of PizzaExpress in London.
The union has also written to the restaurant chains CEO.
So you see my colleagues and I are very reliant on customer tips to top up our low wages.
Ask and Zizzi, two other restaurant chains, also deduct 8% of the tips paid by card.
Cafe_ Rouge, Bella Italia and Belgo deduct 10%; so do Strada and Giraffe.
A spokesperson for PizzaExpress said that its admin charge was to cover the cost of running a tronc  a pay arrangement used to distribute tips among staff.
Frankie & Bennys, Chiquitos and Garfunkels used to charge 10% but they stopped doing this several years ago.
But the employee who wrote to Unite said that, when she mentioned the charge to customers, they were always surprised.
Most customers would then pay the tip in cash.
Almost 6,000 people have signed Unites online petition.
I work in a busy London branch and, on an average night, I serve 150 people and earn 40 to 50 in tips, he says.
That might sound like a lot but that money is crucial to me because my basic pay is only 6.50 an hour.
The research indicates that fewer clouds form as the planet warms, which means less sunlight is reflected back into space.
The way clouds affect global warming has been the biggest mystery in the study of future climate change.
4C would be catastrophic rather than simply dangerous, Sherwood said.
The research reduces the uncertainty about how much warming is caused by rises in carbon emissions, according to scientists commenting on the study, published in the journal Nature.
Experts at Japans National Institute for Environmental Studies said the explanation of how fewer clouds form as the world warms was convincing and agreed that this indicated future climate change would be greater than expected.
Scientists measure the sensitivity of the Earths climate to greenhouse gases by estimating the temperature rise that would be caused by a doubling of CO2 in the atmosphere compared with pre-industrial levels  which is likely to happen within 50 years.
Computer climate models are the only tool researchers have to predict future temperatures and it was important to make sure that the way clouds are formed was represented accurately in those models.
Furthermore, a study in November 2013 suggested the pause may be mainly an illusion  a result of the lack of temperature readings from polar regions, where warming is greatest.
Sherwood accepts his teams work on the role of clouds cannot definitely rule out that future temperature rises will be at the lower end of projections.
The report found that, in parts of rural Kenya and in South Africa, 30 to 40% of people who escaped from poverty fell back again, rising to 60% in some areas of Ethiopia between 1999 and 2009.
Even in successful countries such as Indonesia and Vietnam, the proportion was 20%.
Lovemore, from Zimbabwe, has become one of the poorest people in his village.
He recently lost his job due to bad health and had to take in his  ve grandchildren after the death of his daughters.
The big gains in China are unlikely to be matched by similar progress elsewhere, while climate-related shocks and deep poverty in parts of sub-Saharan Africa will slow down progress.
The report says the focus should be on the chronically poor  those who are poor for many years or their entire lives  and on stopping the descent into poverty.
The report says progress on poverty reduction has had less of an impact on the chronically poor than on those who were already closer to the poverty line.
The  rst is social assistance  to bring the poorest people closer to a decent standard of living.
The third is economic growth policies that ensure that the bene ts of increasing national prosperity reach the very poorest people.
Even Nigeria, with its oil wealth, spends only $650 per person, Shepherd said.
The authors urge governments to develop an inclusive national development plan and to work with civil society to ensure that the poorest people are represented politically as well as trying to stop dif cult social norms, such as dowries and witchcraft, that contribute to extreme poverty: This often means challenging parts of the status quo.     
Now Singerer, a childminder, has joined FemAle, a group of like-minded drinkers in Gothenburg, to make and sell Swedens  rst beer made by women.
We Can Do It was the brainchild of Felicia Nordstro_m, a bar worker who says she was fed up with male beer snobs telling her: What do you know about beer, sweetie?
She talked to FemAle, and they teamed up with Ocean, a local independent micro-brewery.
One weekend they came up with the recipe and the next weekend they brewed 1,600 litres.
FemAle has already been approached by other breweries who want to brew new beers with them.
Women choose a glass of wine because they dont know what beer is all about; they dont know what to order, says Carlsson.
From all across Rwanda, and even parts of neighbouring Burundi, people are coming to the southern town of Butare to a little shop called Inzozi Nziza (Sweet Dreams).
They come for a taste of the unknown, something most have never tasted before  sweet, cold ice cream.
The shop, which has ice cream, coffee, dreams written on its signs, is taking advantage of local curiosity about the dessert  and changing lives in the process, says Inzozi Nzizas manager, Louise Ingabire.
The shop can certainly make dreams come true.
Inzozi Nziza has become a meeting place for tired students looking to treat themselves to something cool and different.
Most of the ingredients are from local sources and the milk comes from nearby Nyanza.
An ice-cream shop, Katese said, might help to put the human pieces back together by rebuilding spirits, hopes and family traditions, Miesen says.
At the start, Miesen and Dundas owned the shop in partnership with its staff and had shares in the business, which is a cooperative and non-pro t. After 18 months, they transferred their shares to the women, who had by then proved they could run the business.
The Butare shop employs nine women, who spend their spare time practising with Ingoma Nshya, Rwandas  rst and only female drumming group, which was established by Katese ten years ago.
Some are survivors of the 1994 genocide, during which almost a million Tutsis and Hutus were killed.
When Im drumming, it gives me power because were still alive and survivors, she says.
Sweet Dreams, which tells the story of how the women have made a promising post-genocide future, also includes the female drummers.
We feel the  lm is about resilience, hope, bravery, resourcefulness and the ability to change the course of your own life, says Lisa Fruchtman.     
McKinlay believes we need huge investment before navigation systems will be good enough for technologies such as autonomous vehicles to take off.
According to Ofcom (the Of ce of Communications), around 66% of adults in the UK owned a smartphone in 2015, up from 39% in 2012  so GPS technology is widely available.
But McKinlay, a satellite communication and navigation consultant, believes that we should be careful not to leave our navigational needs to our devices.
We looked at a group of current London taxi drivers and a group of London taxi drivers that had been retired for about four years, said neuroscientist Dr Hugo Spiers of University College London, who is an author of the study.
The results showed that the retired taxi drivers performed worse on navigation tests than the current taxi drivers.
We were able to show that their abilities dropped away if they werent using their knowledge.
There is a genuine potential danger in relying on a satnav, said Spiers.
But the health risk of not using your brain effectively is not known.
Spiers believes the development of arti cial intelligence based on machine learning could lead to a new wave of navigational aids, but McKinlay is sceptical.
We will see ever-smarter machines which are very, very task speci c, but the big breakthrough will be when they understand what we are thinking and what we want to achieve, he said.
She has a series of adventures as Johansson and, in the end, dies in a car crash.
Delacourt tried to explain that he chose to mention Johansson because she is the archetype of beauty today.
Delacourt is one of Frances best-loved authors; his previous novel, My List of Desires, was translated into 47 languages and is now being adapted into a  lm.
I wrote a real love story about feminine beauty, especially interior beauty.
I thought she might send me  owers as the book was a declaration of love for her, but she didnt understand, Delacourt said.     
A study by one of the UKs leading experts on childrens physical activity has found that school pupils born in those months are  tter than everyone else in their class.
November- and October-born children were  tter, stronger and more powerful than those born in the other ten months of the year, especially those whose birthdays were in April or June.
Dr Gavin Sandercock of Essex University and colleagues found that autumn-born children had a clear physical advantage over their classmates.
The results revealed that a childs month of birth could make signi cant differences to their levels of cardiovascular  tness, muscle strength and ability to accelerate, all of which predict how good someone is at sport.
The gap in physical ability between children in the same class but born in different months was sometimes very wide.
The results show that something other than the relative-age effect  the greater maturity of those born early in the school year  is the cause, especially as the  ttest children were not the tallest or heaviest, he added.
The authors believe that autumn-born childrens greater exposure over the summer months, towards the end of pregnancy, to vitamin D is the most likely explanation.
Seasonal differences in vitamin D concentrations in the womb seem most plausible, they say.
Children that get a high-quality  rst experience are those that will have greater agility, balance and coordination, and are more likely to develop an enjoyment of physical activity and excel in sport as they grow up, he said.
UK Sport could not say if a disproportionate majority of the 1,300 athletes across 47 sports it funds were born in November and October.
She said: With elite, senior athletes, there are many factors that make a champion and our work hasnt uncovered anything to suggest that month of birth is one of the key ingredients. 
As soon as the children at one primary school in Stirling, Scotland, hear the words daily mile, they put down their pencils and leave the classroom to start running around the school  eld.
For three-and-a-half years, all the pupils at St Ninians Primary School have walked or run a mile each day.
They do it at different times during the day and, despite the rise in childhood obesity across the UK, none of the children at the school are overweight.
One in ten children are obese when they start school at the age of four or  ve, according to the Health & Social Care Information Centre, and, in the summer of 2015, a study found that schoolchildren in England are the least  t they have ever been.
Primary schools therefore accept the bene ts of the daily mile.
In Stirling alone, 30 schools have already started or will soon start the daily mile.
They come back inside bright-eyed and rosy-cheeked, how children used to look, said Wyllie.
The extent of the bene ts isnt known yet but researchers from Stirling University have launched a comparative study to look for evidence of the physical, cognitive and emotional bene ts of the daily mile.
Dr Colin Moran, who is leading the study, said: The children dont seem to have problems with obesity; they seem happier and staff say they settle into lessons faster so we designed a study that would test all of these things.
St Ninians pupils will be compared with children from another school in Stirling that hasnt yet started the scheme.
Kevin Clelland, a primary school teacher from Leeds, visited St Ninians and, then, convinced his colleagues it was a great idea.
Active Cheshire, a sports and  tness organization in Cheshire, is taking a group of senior people from the local authority up to Scotland to assess the results of the daily mile.
The hope is to introduce it across the 450 schools in their region if a pilot programme is successful.
Paralympian, Tanni Grey-Thompson, chair of ukactive, a health organization for physical activity, said: All children need to achieve 60 active minutes every day, whether in a lesson, on the walk to school or in the playground.
The Scottish government also supports the initiative.
Now, for the  rst time, scientists have started to catalogue and map the bacteria in a citys subway  and they have found many interesting results.
Dr Christopher Mason, a geneticist at Weill Cornell Medical College, led a team that, for 18 months, tested the New York City subway system for the microscopic life forms that cover its turnstiles, seats, ticket booths and stations.
His team found meningitis at Times Square, a trace of anthrax on the handhold of a train carriage and bacteria that cause bubonic plague on a rubbish bin and ticket machine at stations in uptown Manhattan.
Some of the results were expected and should be a gentle reminder for people to wash their hands, Mason said.
All around the subway, bacteria associated with cheeses  brie, cheddar, parmesan and the mozzarella found on New York pizza  appeared.
The distinctive bacteria of Swiss cheese were more limited to midtown Manhattan and the  nancial district, and the bacteria used to ferment cabbage for kimchi and sauerkraut showed up in the  nancial district and Bay Ridge.
Species that cause diarrhoea and nausea, as well as E.coli, and the bacteria that can cause skin infections and urinary-tract infections were common all over the city.
In fact, he added, Ive become much more con dent riding the subway.
The next steps, Mason said, are studies of other cities, which have begun in Paris, Sa_o Paolo and Shanghai, and continued studies of New York, for instance to see how the results change with the seasons.
He said he hoped the research would provide a baseline of research for health of cials and geneticists, and could help health of cials to prevent and track diseases and pathogens. 
The UK prime minister, David Cameron, has declared a clear result in the Scottish independence referendum  Scotland voted by a 10.6-point margin against ending the 307-year- old union with England and Wales.
Earlier, Scotlands  rst minister, Alex Salmond, remained de ant at a Scottish National Party rally in Edinburgh  he said he accepted Scotland had not, at this stage, decided to vote for independence.
The yes campaign won four big successes  it won 53% of the vote in Scotlands largest city, Glasgow, 57% in Dundee and 51% in North Lanarkshire.
However, the no campaign was victorious in 28 authorities.
It won easily in areas where it was expected to do well, including Edinburgh, Aberdeenshire and Borders, but also in areas that could have gone to the yes campaign, including the Western Isles.
In the  nal count, the no camp won 2,001,926 votes (55.3%) and the yes camp won 1,617,989 votes (44.7%).
And I know that feeling was shared by people not just across our country but around the world because of what we have achieved together in the past and what we can do together in the future.
Ed Miliband, the leader of the Labour Party, said the referendum was a vote from the Scottish people for change.
We know our country needs to change.
Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister, said the referendum was not only a new chapter for Scotland within the UK but also wider constitutional reform across the union.
He said a vote against independence was not a vote against change.
Yet that result raises the risk of further problems  MPs from Camerons Conservative Party are threatening to vote against the prime ministers promise to quickly increase the Scottish parliaments powers and protect its spending.
The prime minister wants to move fast to show that the three main UK party leaders will meet the commitments they made during the referendum campaign.
SeaWorld has suffered an 84% collapse in pro ts  customers have deserted the controversial aquatic theme park company because of claims that it mistreated orca whales.
After the documentary was shown, attendance collapsed and the company lost more than half of its market value on Wall Street.
Talking about the companys reputation, he said, Early feedback on our campaign has been positive.
We will continue to  ght with the facts because the facts are on our side, he said.
Manby, who joined the company as CEO in 2015 to help the company recover, said he would give a presentation on his vision for the future of the company at a special event on 6 November.
There are already plans for a new shark exhibition in Orlando and an attraction in San Antonio that will allow customers to swim with dolphins in a naturalistic setting.
Jared Goodman, director of animal law for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), said: SeaWorld has a spying scandal, animals are dying in its tanks and tens of thousands of people are against its plan to build a new orca prison.
SeaWorlds shares, which were worth $39 in 2013, fell to just under $18 in August 2015. 
Stratford remained hugely important during Shakespeares life, says Paul Edmondson, the head of learning and research at the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust.
People often see Shakespeare as someone who turned his back on Stratford and his family, went to London to earn his fortune and only came back to die, he said.
The anniversary of the death of the man from Stratford, the most famous and the most performed playwright in the world, will be celebrated across Britain and the globe.
In London, they are also creating a 37-screen pop-up cinema, one screen to showcase each of Shakespeares plays.
The National Theatre, the Royal Shakespeare Company and nearly every other theatre production company in the country will celebrate the anniversary.
The plays would probably not have survived if his friends and fellow actors had not gathered together every bit of every play they could  nd  drafts, prompt scripts, scribbled actors parts and 17 plays not known in any other version  into the precious First Folio published in 1623, seven years after Shakespeares death.
The Shakespeare Birthplace Trust describes New Place as the jewel in the crown of the 400th anniversary celebrations.
The low rumble of passing ships has, for a long time, been connected to the disturbance of large whales.
But, US researchers have also found noise at medium and higher frequencies, including at 20,000Hz where killer whales, also known as orcas, hear best.
The  ndings suggest that the noise could affect the endangered population of killer whales that are found near the shipping lanes up the west coast of the USA.
The main concern of this is that even a slight increase in sound may make echolocation more dif cult for whales, said Scott Veirs, who led the research.
The researchers used underwater microphones to measure the noise created by about 1,600 ships as they passed through Haro Strait, in Washington State, USA.
The two-year study recorded the sound made by 12 different types of vessel, including cruise ships, container ships and military vehicles, that passed through the strait about 20 times a day.
Whales are not usually right next to ships and so would hear noise of about 60 to 90 decibels  around the level of a lawnmower or a vacuum cleaner.
But, the new research shows the threat to smaller whales, dolphins and porpoises.
Ships have been thought of as low-frequency sources of noise, like the rumbling of lorries or trains, he said.
And, if they fail to  nd prey as effectively, they will need to use up their stores of extra blubber.
This is a problem because this blubber often contains manmade pollutants that are toxic to whales if they are released fully into their systems.
Veirs said more work needs to be done to identify how badly the noise is affecting whales and also to quieten the ships that pass near them.
Military ships are quite a bit quieter and there could be simple ways of transferring that technology to commercial ships.
Decreasing speed by six knots could decrease noise by half.
While some whale species, such as blue whales, the largest mammal on Earth, are safer now because whaling has declined, others are still under threat from a range of factors.
The US federal government has recently protected nearly 40,000 square miles of the Atlantic to try to avoid losing a species of whale with just 500 individuals left.
In Europe, killer whales are carrying dangerously high levels of banned chemicals in their blubber.
Meanwhile, around the coast of Australia, whales face an increased threat from ship strikes and oil and gas drilling, as well as Japans recent decision to start whaling again in Antarctic waters. 
What surprised researchers was not how hard people found the challenge but how far they would go to avoid it.
Some found it so unbearable that they took the safe but alarming opportunity to give themselves mild electric shocks to break the tedium.
The difference, scientists suspect, is that men are typically more sensation-seeking than women.
The report from psychologists at Virginia and Harvard Universities tries to answer the question of why most of us  nd it so hard to do nothing.
In more than 11 separate studies, the researchers showed that people hated being left to think, regardless of their age, education, income or the amount of time they spent on smartphones or social media.
Timothy Wilson, who led the work, said the  ndings were not necessarily due to the pace of modern life or the spread of mobile devices and social media.
Instead, those things might be popular because of our constant need to do something rather than nothing.
In the  rst experiments, students were taken  alone, without phones, books or anything to write with  into a room and told to think.
To see if the effect was found only in students, the scientists tested more than 100 other people, aged 18 to 77, from a church and a farmers market.
To check whether people might actually prefer something bad to nothing at all, the students were given the option of giving themselves a mild electric shock.
They had been asked earlier to say how unpleasant the shocks were, compared to other options, such as looking at pictures of cockroaches or hearing the sound of a knife rubbing against a bottle.
Jessica Andrews-Hanna at the University of Colorado said many students would probably give themselves an electric shock to cheer up a tedious lecture.
But, she says we need to know more about the motivation of the shockers in Wilsons study.
Imagine  a person is told to sit in a chair with wires attached to their skin and a button that will deliver a harmless but uncomfortable shock, and they are told to just sit there with their thoughts, she said.
As they sit there, their mind starts to wander and it naturally goes to that shock  was it really that bad?   
If you pick up a boot, a camera will make sure you dont put it into your bag.
Intel spokesman Joe Jensen says that the aim of using RealSense technology in shops is not to create databases of speci c peoples lives but to build generalized models of peoples lifestyles and shopping habits.
We dont need to know a particular customer.
We need to know that this shopper has these characteristics and that, when those characteristics are present, this is what a person tends to do.
That could allow a store to automatically put targeted ads on screens aimed speci cally at that person.
If you search for something on Amazon, youll get targeted ads for similar products on other sites.
People do not react to cameras in the same way as they do to browser cookies.
Hoxton Analytics, a team of data scientists in London, has developed a technology that uses machine learning and arti cial intelligence to categorize people based on the shoes they are wearing.
By analysing the style and size of peoples footwear as they walk past the sensor, the system can identify a customers gender with 75-80% accuracy.
Owen McCormack, Hoxton Analytics CEO, says that the focus of the system was partly a reaction to facial recognition.
My idea was, why dont we simply consider the clothes someones wearing?
If I just showed you a photo of someones body, you could probably tell me what gender they are.
However, pointing a camera at someones chest or hips feels just as creepy as facial recognition.
People use the word creepy a lot during discussions of in-store tracking.
From the perspective of stores, its understandable that physical shops want some of the information online shops collect.
In any case, there are a growing number of eyes between the shelves and they care a lot about what youre wearing.     
They may not know who Steve Jobs was or even how to tie their own shoelaces, but the average six-year-old child understands more about digital technology than a 45-year-old adult, according to a new report.
The arrival of broadband in the year 2000 has created a generation of digital natives, Ofcom (which checks standards in the UK communications industries) says in its annual study of British consumers.
As a result of growing up in the digital age, they are developing completely different communication habits from older generations, even compared to the 16-to-24 age group.
800 children and 2,000 adults took Ofcoms digital quotient, or DQ, test, which attempts to gauge awareness of and self-con dence around gadgets from tablets to smart watches, knowledge of superfast internet, 4G mobile- phone networks and mobile apps.
Digital understanding peaks between 14 and 15 years old, with a DQ of 113, and then drops gradually throughout adulthood, before falling rapidly in old age.
The ways in which millennial children contact each other and consume entertainment are so different from previous generations that forecasters now believe their preferences to be a better indication of the future than the preferences of trendsetting young adults.
Two decades ago, teenagers spent their evenings monopolizing the home telephone line, talking about love affairs and friendships in conversations that lasted for hours.
Just 2% of childrens time using devices is spent emailing, compared to 33% for adults.
They spend 20% of their time viewing short video clips, for example on YouTube, or news clips on Facebook and other social sites.
Young adults aged 16 to 24 are big media consumers.
They call him the Robin Hood of the banks, a man who took out many loans worth almost half a million euros with no intention of ever paying them back.
Instead, Enric Duran gave the money to projects that created and promoted alternatives to capitalism.
After 14 months in hiding, Duran is unapologetic, even though his activities could put him in jail.
Im proud of what I did, he said in an interview by Skype from a secret location.
Meanwhile, constant growth was creating a system that created money out of nothing.
He spent two months in prison before being let out on 50,000 bail.
His actions, he said, were an important part of a worldwide debate on the economic crisis.
In his case, he said, he could offer banks the insight he got from years of obtaining bank loans fraudulently.
More than 25,000 kilos of dead  sh were collected afterwards and nearly 2,000 adult birds, chicks, eggs and nests were killed or destroyed.
Suddenly aware of Donanas status as the nations most important natural site, Spain decided to spend a further 360m, some of it EU money, on restoring the landscape.
However, the real body blow for conservationists has been the recent decision of the Andalucian government to reopen the Frailes mine that nearly destroyed Donana in 1998.
Donana already faces a large number of threats, but now they want to bring back the very cause of the disaster 16 years ago.
The crash of Spains banks in 2008 had a catastrophic effect on the region and unemployment in some parts of Andalucia is now more than 30%.
Reopening the mine would provide more than 1,000 jobs.
There are riches here, riches that are badly needed by local inhabitants, said energy spokesman Vicente Fernandez Guerrero.
People have been digging metals here since Roman times.
Fernandez said that the mine licence would only allow modern mining techniques, which avoid the creation of poisonous wet waste.
The plan has some support in the area, but it also has a lot of opposition.
Carlos Davila, who works for the Spanish Ornithological Society in Donana, was also alarmed at the plan.
This is a very, very bad idea, he said.
This is not surprising because this is a very special place.
The trouble is that Spain does not have the public resources it had 16 years ago.
This point is supported by Davila.
After the disaster, Spain realized that it had a place of real ecological importance and did a lot to clean it up and protect it, he added.
That movie will outline a rebel mission to steal the plans of the Death Star, a key part of the story in the  rst  lm in 1977.
In creating a multi-storyline, multi-character cinema universe around Star Wars, Lucas lm-Disney are copying the phenomenally successful series of  lms produced by Marvel Studios, which Disney also bought, in 2009.
Disney has increased the level of marketing savvy to a product that was already popular: Dergarabedian says the decision to make all six existing Star Wars  lms available on streaming services is a brilliant way to build the excitement for the new  lm and reinvigorate the idea of Star Wars in the minds of the fans.
Michael Rosser, news editor for Screen International, suggests that it is this shared universe of nostalgia that makes Star Wars the top  lm franchise.
Rosser is referring to the three  lms Lucas directed between 1999 and 2005  The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith  which were about the life of Luke Skywalkers father, Anakin, who becomes Darth Vader.
It shows the power of Star Wars that, although they were disappointing, the prequels still made a lot of money, said Rosser.
They also want people to go to the cinema at a time when lots are staying home for entertainment.
Meanwhile, Dergarabedian expects massive business when The Force Awakens reaches cinemas in December 2015.
We certainly expect a record opening for December and the  lm should make at least a billion dollars worldwide.
We may not yet be living in an age of  ying cars, as predicted in the 1985  lm Back to the Future II, but the rise of smartphones and other new technologies is creating a reality that is just as exciting and almost as far-fetched.
Experts agree that economic and demographic changes, technological advances, and environmental concerns are fundamentally changing transportation.
Theres a tighter connection between transportation and the economic health of cities and its impact on people.
Connectivity Ride-sharing services like Uber  taxis booked via smartphone  and apps like Waze, which uses real-time traf c data to  nd the quickest routes for drivers, are dramatically changing how people move around and affecting the way traf c moves through a city.
People still driving cars are dealing with less traf c thanks to Waze.
Companies are working to develop technology that will allow a vehicle to tell traf c control systems not only that it is present but also where it is going and how fast it is travelling.
But, even if driverless technology were ready to use now, it would take a long time to get fully automated because the average age of cars on the road is 11.5 years old.
DNA taken from the wisdom tooth of a European hunter-gatherer has given scientists a glimpse of modern humans before the rise of farming.
He was probably lactose intolerant and had more difficulty digesting starchy foods than the farmers whose diets and lifestyles changed in the first agricultural revolution.
But scientists may have overestimated the impact farming had on the human immune system, because tests on the hunter-gatherers DNA found that he already carried genes that boost the immune system.
The Spanish team started their work after a group of cave explorers found two skeletons in a deep and complex cave system high up in the Cantabrian Mountains of northwest Spain in 2006.
Carbon dating put the remains at around 7,000 years old, before farming arrived in Europe from the Middle East.
It is the first time researchers have got the complete genome of a modern European who lived before the Neolithic revolution.
The results suggest that blue eye colour came first in Europe and that the change to lighter skin happened throughout Mesolithic times.
You never see a reconstruction of a Mesolithic hunter-gatherer with dark skin and blue eyes, Lalueza-Fox said.
The Spanish team compared the genome of the hunter-gatherer to those of modern Europeans from different regions to see how they might be related.
Martin Jones, professor of archaeological science at Cambridge University, said the immunity genes were the most interesting result.
Two mothers in South Africa have found out that they are raising each others daughters after they were mistakenly switched at birth in a hospital in 2010.
But, while one of the women wants to correct the error and get her biological child back, the other is refusing to give back the girl she has raised as her own.
Henk Strydom, a lawyer for one of the mothers, described the swap as a travesty and tragedy that is unlikely to have a happy ending.
Strydom said: The man denied he was the father.
Here they have met their biological daughters  Strydom said of his client: She said there are resemblances to herself.
The woman became unhappy with the process and asked the childrens court to give her custody of her biological child, but the other mother refused.
She wants the baby back, but its four years later: you can understand that the other mother doesnt want to give up her baby, Strydom said.
The High Court in Pretoria has asked the University of Pretorias Centre for Child Law to investigate what will now be in the best interests of the children.
He said, at this point, he and his client do not want to sue the hospital or government health department, which is helping with the case and providing counselling.
The children and mothers will have clinical assessments and may be seen by a psychologist.
It is not the first child-swap case in South Africa.
He grew up on welfare and became a truck driver, whereas his biological brothers and sisters  and the boy brought up in his place  attended private secondary schools and universities.
There are many quirky solutions to help make our cities more livable, such as glow-in-the-dark trees, underground bike sheds and solar-powered bins.
City living has many upsides but a sustainable lifestyle is not always one of them.
Pollution, traf c and loss of green spaces are just some of the daily problems that city-dwellers have to deal with.
Take an empty car park, a small amount of money and a pot plant or two, and make yourself your own private park.
Subterranean storage Not all urban dwellers have cars.
Just seven metres wide, the cylindrical storage facility buries deep into the ground and can hold 204 bikes.
Glow-in-the-dark trees When most people think of trees that glow in the dark, Christmas trees usually come to mind.
The Dutch designer-artist has invented a bioluminescent plant.
The experimental technology joins DNA from luminescent marine bacteria with the chloroplast genome of a plant to create a glow like a jelly sh.

The Greek island of Agios Efstratios is so remote, so forgotten by the banks, the government and most of the modern world that there isnt a single ATM or credit-card machine on the island.
Residents have to make nine-hour round trips to the nearest big island to get cash and Greek visitors say they cant get hold of enough money to come.
Tourist numbers have reduced by 80% this year, said Mayor Maria Kakali, in an of ce in the village where she grew up, with a population of around 200 people.
Kakali has badgered the government and a major Greek bank into promising an ATM within weeks but she still feels it may be too late for this season on an island where tourism is the main source of income: We have almost no reservations in August, when usually we have people calling us up asking to  nd a room and we cant help them.
Everything, even milk or bread, has been bought and sold three or four times before it gets to us and everyone has to take a pro t, said Provatas Costas, a 58-year-old  sherman.
Lemnos has dozens of wild beaches, where you can swim and sunbathe virtually alone, a small nightlife scene and many cultural sites.
If taxes go up, even more young people will leave, warns Mayor Kakali, who has worked to improve education on the island to help keep it an attractive place for families.
There are too many festivals and there are not enough big acts to headline them.
So, with no big acts to headline, there are no big shows.
There is going to be a growth in events where it isnt just music but with poetry or books or magic shows.
There will be lots of small combination festivals that give something extra  not people standing around in a big  eld unable to go to the toilet because they might miss the band.

Cathal Redmond was swimming off the Greek coast and he was sure he had taken some great photos of colourful  sh with his  rst underwater camera.
He took the pictures while holding his breath underwater and blamed the limited time he had to set up the shots.
He decided to invent something to make that little extra time a reality and the result is his invention of the Express Dive  a re llable air storage device, which is held in the mouth and lets people swim underwater for two minutes.
So, rather than just go underwater and spend 30 seconds holding their breath, I wanted people to do a little bit more, says Redmond, 27.
The real problem is that scuba diving is very limiting.
It was during a  nal-year project for his product design degree that Redmond produced the Express Dive.
When above the surface, the unit sucks in air through a vent in the mouthpiece.
When air is no longer being taken in, the vent shuts off and, as the person dives, air is fed back via the mouthpiece.
The device can take in enough air for two minutes of diving and takes approximately the same amount of time to re ll.
He compares it to an extension of the lungs in that the user is taking a deep breath and then using it underwater.
It is an extension of the bodys ability to store air, he says.
Redmond says he has shown that the motor can compress two minutes worth of air into the unit and that the design can be held in the divers mouth.
But, with enough testing, Redmond is con dent he can get a fully working device that will not endanger swimmers underwater.
To anyone who thinks two minutes of air is no more than a very small improvement on snorkelling, Redmond says it could make a big difference underwater.
She last deactivated her account in December 2015 because she found the amount of personal information shared by others too heavy to deal with in addition to her work demands.
In my job, I spend a lot of time listening to peoples lives all day, every day and it started to feel so overwhelming to go on social media and see every single detail of everybodys lives, including people that I dont really have a relationship with, she said.

His billing, The Beale Street Blues Boy, was shortened to Blues Boy King and then to BB.
He was always ready to praise the musicians who had in uenced him  he would usually mention T-Bone Walker  rst.
He once explained that his guitar technique was partly based on his lack of skill: I started to bend notes because I could never play in the bottleneck style.
The 1965 album Live at the Regal, however, has become iconic, a turning point in the early listening of many younger musicians.
He had further R&B hits with blues numbers including How Blue Can You Get and Paying the Cost to Be the Boss, and, in 1969, he got near the top of the pop charts  where no blues artist had been for many years  with The Thrill Is Gone.
About a year and a half ago, he said in 1969, all of a sudden, kids started saying to me, Youre the greatest blues guitarist in the world.
Guided by his manager, Sidney Seidenberg, he went on international concert tours that took him to Japan, Australia, China and Russia.
He also gave concerts to prisoners at the Cook County jail in Chicago and at San Quentin, which led to his long involvement in rehabilitation programmes.
In 1990, King was diagnosed with diabetes and cut back his touring but his followers outside the US could still see him every year or two.
The celebrations for his 80th birthday, in 2005, included an award-winning album of collaborations with Clapton, Mark Knop er, Roger Daltrey, Gloria Estefan and others, tributes from musicians as diverse as Bono, Amadou Bagayoko and Elton John, and a goodbye tour that was not a goodbye at all.
Statistics suggest that vaping among smokers and recent ex-smokers, who are the vast majority of vapers, may already be declining.
Figures released in 2014 by the health charity Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) reveal that usage among adults in Britain of electronic cigarettes  which do not contain tobacco and produce vapour, not smoke  has tripled from 700,000 users in 2012 to 2.1 million in 2014.
However,  gures collated by the Smoking Toolkit Study, a research organization that provides quarterly updates on smoking trends, show vapings appeal may be declining.
The drop is described as statistically signi cant by Professor Robert West, who collates the  gures for the Toolkit.
Smokers are the key group for e-cigarette companies because seven out of ten vapers are smokers.
Weve only been studying vaping for just over a year, so its a short time period, but we are not seeing growth in the number of long-term ex-smokers or never smokers using e-cigarettes.
Vaping rates might change but, at this stage, it looks like theyre staying the same.
The fact that vaping has stopped growing in popularity in the UK seems to be at odds with what is happening in the US, where the technology has been promoted aggressively and where reports suggest it is growing in popularity.
Instead, e-cigarettes seem to be most popular among adults who want to quit.
While the  gures published this month by Smoking In England show that the use of electronic cigarettes by smokers has stopped rising, their data also shows the huge increase in use since May 2011, said James Dunworth, of ecigarettedirect.co.uk.
E-cigarettes behave like a sort of nicotine patch, West agreed.
The European Commission (EC) is looking at increasing taxes on e-cigarettes, which could have an impact on their popularity.
This may mean vapers will have to increase their usage to get the same effect, again something that may make e-cigarettes more expensive.
West suggested that policymakers should see e-cigarettes as an aid to stopping smoking and not have the same regulations for them as for smoking.
It just sounds like youre having a go at vapers and that undermines the public health messages were trying to get out.
Vienna is the worlds best city to live in, Baghdad is the worst and London, Paris and New York do not even enter the top 35, according to international research into quality of life.
Helena Hartlauer, 32, from Vienna, said she was not surprised at her citys top position.
The citys social democratic government has a long tradition of investing money in high-quality social housing, which makes Vienna less expensive than other major cities.
I live in a 100sq-metre apartment in a good area about 20 minutes walk from the city centre.
A similar apartment in London would cost over 2,000 and even more in New York, ranked 44th in the table.
You dont realize how safe Vienna is until you go abroad, said Hartlauer.
Vienna bene ted enormously from the fall of the Berlin Wall, becoming the gateway to Eastern European countries that often have historic connections to the former Austro-Hungarian empire.
Our big USP (unique selling point) is our geographical location, said Martin Eichtinger, Austrian ambassador to London, who lived in Vienna for 20 years.
The fall of the Berlin Wall helped make Vienna a hub for companies wanting to do business in Central Europe.
According to the World Bank, Austria has one of the highest  gures for GDP (gross domestic product) per person in the world, just behind the US and ahead of Germany and Britain, although below neighbouring Switzerland.
Mercer says Zurich in Switzerland has the worlds second highest quality of life but the Viennese say their city is far more fun.
Its a very fast growing, young and lively city, she added.
But, after an increase in budget  ights from British cities such as Manchester and Edinburgh, Vienna is becoming a more popular destination.
Vienna has ranked top in the last seven surveys, said Mercer.
It scores highly in a number of categories; it provides a safe and stable environment to live in, a high standard of public transport and good recreational facilities.
Paris has remained stable for several years but has, this year, dropped ten places, said Mercer.
Australian cities also do well in the survey, with Sydney 10th and Melbourne 15th.
All restaurants should have to publicly state their exact tipping policy.
Elle, 22, Edinburgh: We never know whether its fair Average tips: 20 per eight-hour shift I think they treat waiters best in ... France  I have three part-time catering jobs.
In restaurants, because a lot of customers add tips through card payments, the staff never see how much the tip is  so we dont know whether what we get is fair or not.
The system seems better in France, where they dont tip much but being a waiter is seen as a proper job, with job security and a decent income.
Or, when a member of the team does incredibly well, they dont get what theyve earned.
The managers should have ways to pay for broken glasses and plates without taking our tips.
I make around 20 a shift in tips but often I only get 10-15 of that money.
Id rather we earned a good basic wage (like in Australia) and didnt have to rely on tips.
Tom, Manchester: A big night of tips can help pay the rent Average tips: 40 per eight-hour shift I think they treat waiters best in ... Italy  Where I used to work, waiters kept 80% of cash tips and 40% of card tips.
The other 20% of cash went into a pot for the commis waiters and bar staff.
Its hard to say how much I earned a shift; maybe around 40.
They have got tipping right in Italy, where customers dont add a service charge but usually round up their bill so, if their meal is 19, they leave a 20 note and dont ask for change.

School and university reunions are unnecessary  you already know whose career is going well, whether the perfect pair have split and youve seen pictures of your schoolmates babies.

Professor Robin Dunbar is famous for his research that suggests a person can only have about 150 people as a social group.
Ninety- one per cent post a photo of themselves, 71% post the city or town where they live, more than half give email addresses and a  fth give their phone number.
More than 80% of Facebook users list their interests, which allows brands to target them effectively.
But most younger users limit who can see their pro les, with 60% allowing friends only.
3 Facebook has created millions of jobs  but not in its own of ces Facebook provides indirect employment for people whose job it is to make Facebook work for their brand.
Marketers have an understanding of a brands customers like they have never had before.
The data available is extraordinary.
4 Facebook has been the tool to organize revolutions Organizing demonstrations and direct action has been revolutionized by Facebook.
Manchester Universitys Olga Onuch found Facebook had been the key way for reaching half of all the Euromaidan protesters in Ukraine.
Many of the people interviewed in Onuchs research said they relied on Facebook for the truth about what was happening  they dont trust traditional media.
For better or (often) worse, it is a place to  nd information on almost any ordinary person, who might suddenly  nd themselves at the centre of the days biggest news story.
In 2014, ten years after its launch, 56% of internet users aged 65 and older have a Facebook account.
This includes about 45% of all fruit and vegetables, 35% of  sh and seafood, 30% of cereals, 20% of dairy products and 20% of meat.
By 2050, food production will have to increase by 60%, compared to 2005 levels, to feed a growing global population.
The problem is global but appears in very different ways.
In wealthy countries, there are low levels of food loss but high levels of food waste, which means food is thrown away by consumers because they have purchased too much or by retailers who reject food because of strict standards of appearance.
The carbon footprint of food produced and not eaten is estimated at 3.3 gigatonnes of CO2  this means that, if food waste were a country, it would be the third highest emitter of greenhouse gases after the US and China.
About 30% of available agricultural land is used to grow or farm food that is subsequently wasted.
And more surface and groundwater is used to produce wasted food around the globe than is used for agriculture by any single country, including India and China.
Climate change is caused by our economy of production and consumption because it is out of balance with what the Earth can provide, says van Otterdijk.
Production of food is one of the biggest production sectors in the world and, if one-third of all this is wasted, you can imagine what a huge effect this has on the natural resources  on land, water, energy and greenhouse gas emissions.
The places that waste the most food are the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, where consumers waste 39% of all food purchased.
This means that 11.7% of all food purchased is wasted, which costs each family 700 a year.
The most wasted food in the UK by weight is bread, with consumers throwing away 414,000 tonnes (22.4%) of all bread purchased.
The UK has made progress in the past ten years after a campaign to reduce waste.
Between 2007 and 2012, the amount of food waste produced by UK households decreased by 21%, from 5.3m tonnes to 4.2m tonnes, largely due to greater awareness.
Van Otterdijk says there has been a very encouraging, unexpected, continuing interest in food waste and this enables campaigns around the world to gain momentum.
But, if it continues like this, maybe, after ten years, well have globally signi cant results.   
Clay Cockrell is sitting in his of ce across the street from 1 Central Park West, the address of the Trump International Hotel and Tower.
Cockrell, a former Wall Street worker who is now a therapist, spends large parts of his days walking through Central Park or the Battery Park in downtown Manhattan near Wall Street, as a con dant and counsellor to some of New Yorks wealthiest people  Many of the extremely wealthy  the 1% of the 1%  feel that their problems are really not problems.
So, what issues do Americas 1% have?
And, then, there is the isolation  being in the 1% can be lonely.
The Occupy Wall Street movement was a good one and had some important things to say about income inequality but it singled out the 1% as something negative, said Jamie Traeger-Muney, a wealth psychologist and founder of the Wealth Legacy Group.
Traeger-Muney runs a global business and specializes in working with inheritors, who often get a bad reputation in the press.
You would never refer to another group of people in the way that it seems perfectly normal to refer to wealthy people.
But its harder to talk about having money than it is to talk about not having money.
According to research from Spectrem Group, in 2014, the number of US households with $1m or more  excluding the value of their main home  increased by 500,000 to 10.1m.
Since the 2008  nancial crisis, the income gap has grown and the situation has gotten worse for the wealthy, Cockrell said.
Never being able to trust your friendships with other people, I think that is dif cult, said Cockrell.
These are real fears of the richest of the rich.
In 2007, the Gates Foundation and Boston Colleges Center on Wealth and Philanthropy started to document what it felt like to be in Americas 1%.
For the next four years, researchers surveyed 165 of Americas richest households  120 of those households have at least $25m.
The report, The Joys and Dilemmas of Wealth, was 500 pages long and seemed to prove the old saying that money cant buy happiness.
Some Americans keep their wealth secret.
There are a lot of people that hide their wealth because they are worried about negative judgment, said Traeger-Muney.
Speaking in his soft, soothing voice that makes you want to tell him all your worries, Cockrell said that a common mistake that many of his wealthy clients make is letting their money define them.
According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), there were only 41m subscribers using music streaming services around the world in 2014.
Some sources suggest that Apple is aiming to reach 100m subscribers, which, based on a subscription fee of $120 per year, would generate $12bn annually.
Apple is good at making products go mainstream but its not that good.
Apple managed to persuade consumers to pay for downloads and grew a huge business with an estimated 70% market share.
Apple holds the lions share of this  it is biggest music retailer in the world.
But download revenue reached a peak in 2013 in the UK at 283m and fell to 249m in 2014.
The decline in download sales hit the US in 2013 so Apple bought Beats in 2014 for $3bn in order to get into the premium headphone market and, also, to make the transition from music ownership (downloads) to music access (subscription streaming).
Apple, and the record industry, cannot afford to get rid of the download market just yet  so streaming and downloading will have to coexist under the Apple brand.
The average spend of a music buyer in the UK in 2014, for example, was just 39.52.
Apple have previously tried to be artist-friendly via iTunes.
It didnt work.
There is the smell of revolution in the air and Apple is making sure its on the right side of the battle.
This is going to be the interesting bit when the service goes live.
Getting exclusives for big albums will be crucial to streaming.
Apple was watching this carefully and making notes.
Nowadays, its lowest point, Piazza San Marco (only three feet above sea level) is inundated with water approximately 100 times a year.
In Venice, subsoil compaction (a result of industrial exploitation of the surrounding area) lowered the city by 20cm between 1950 and 1970.
Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam is also sinking by about 2cm a year  but thats nothing compared to Jakarta, which is dropping 10 to 20cm each year.
Unfortunately for the Indonesian capital, it has pumped out so much groundwater to support its population that the land above is drying out and compacting  this has created a bowl.
While there are many plans to save Venice  and Ho Chi Minh City and Jakarta are taking the problem seriously  the same cannot be said for Miami, where politicians refuse to admit the city has a serious environmental problem.
It is less than ten feet above sea level; an increasing number of tropical storms are inundating the city; and it is built on porous rock, which is absorbing the rising seawater.
This water then  lls the citys foundations and comes up through drains and pipes, forcing sewage upwards and polluting its fresh water.
In the Maldives, the populations of whole islands are now considering abandoning their homes.
The capital, Male_, population 153,379 and only four feet above sea level, has built a ten-foot sea wall at a cost of $63 million  but, long term, only a stabilization of rising sea levels will save it and the rest of the islands.
This city is just one example of a problem caused not so much by global warming as human over-expansion.
Californias dream of farming the desert made sense while its total population remained around half a million (in 1870)  but now the state is home to 38 million people, who own 32 million vehicles.
The daily water use in Rancho Mirage is more than 200 gallons per person, which is causing a man-made drought.
A 25% cut in water use has been implemented but this is unlikely to stabilize the resort, which is surrounded by sand and dust.
The long-term answer in Californias desert is likely to be the abandonment of some cities.

Im ready to give up at 45 seconds but I continue and it seems to get easier for a while.
By the end of the session, Id managed 90 seconds of breath-holding, enough to let me swim a width.
I asked how she did it: very slow breathing for several minutes before each dive, then a big, deep breath before diving in.
Some even say that humans have an ability to lower their heart rate in order to breath-hold for even longer.
And evidence shows that our heart rate doesnt drop during breath-holding.
This reduction in heart rate is just one of the physiological responses that are sometimes called the mammalian diving re ex.
While our ability to breath-hold may not be special, when we compare ourselves with other animals, its now becoming very useful in one particular area of medicine.
Radiotherapy for breast cancer involves pointing radiation, very precisely, at the tumour.
This may require several minutes of radiation and, so, its usually done in short periods, between breaths.
But, if the patient can keep her chest perfectly still for several minutes, it means that the entire dose can be given, in the right place, in one go.
The problem, of course, is that most people, just like me, cannot hold their breath for much longer than a minute.
When you breathe in, youre pulling the muscle of your diaphragm  at so that the volume of your chest increases  and air is pulled into your lungs.
If you arti cially raise oxygen levels and reduce carbon dioxide levels before a breath-hold, as in the Birmingham radiotherapy experiments, you may be able to delay tiredness in the diaphragm.
First, he outraged prisoners of war by doubting the heroism of Vietnam veteran John McCain because he allowed himself to be captured.
Trump has also insulted Mexican immigrants to the US, claimed that a Black Lives Matter protester who was violently thrown out of a rally deserved to be roughed up, appeared to laugh at a New York Times journalist for his disability and falsely accused Muslim Americans of supporting the 9/11 attackers.
But, he has refused to retract any of the comments.
Some rivals still hope that, eventually, even Trumps supporters will get tired of his attacks on minorities.
As he is happy to tell supporters, the three things that he is most against  immigration reform, free-trade deals and Barack Obamas national security policy  have become perhaps the most important issues of the election.
might sound unrealistic but they have destroyed the campaign hopes of Jeb Bush, who favours immigration reform.
Among Americans who say they are Republicans, current polls suggest he has 25-30% of the vote.
In the political battle for hearts and minds, converting Trumps passionate supporters will be hard.
This scenario can be best understood by looking at responses to the question: Which candidates would you de nitely not support for the Republican nomination for president?
Steve Deace, an Iowa conservative, said that Trumps behaviour is both a good and a bad thing.
On the other hand, it limits his ability to grow beyond that.
He says, Trump says what theyre thinking and, the more outrageous he is, the more they agree with him.
That is certainly the feeling among ordinary supporters who have attended his increasingly packed campaign events recently.
Sometimes life isnt fair.
There have been arguments for years over who is the inventor of the ATM and, in 2005, a man called John Shepherd-Barron received a UK honour as the inventor of the automatic cash dispenser.
But, the UK government is now saying it was Goodfellow who invented the ATM  so it seems that, after all the arguments, he now has his place in history.
Back in the mid-1960s, Goodfellow was working as a development engineer and was asked to devise a way to allow customers to withdraw cash from banks on Saturdays.
I wanted to develop a cash-issuing machine and, to make this a reality, I invented the PIN [personal identi cation number] and a coded token.
His machine didnt use plastic cards  instead, it used cheques containing carbon-14, a mildly radioactive substance.
It is widely accepted that the Shepherd-Barron ATM was the worlds  rst to be installed and used by the public; the  rst one, at a bank in north London, was opened on 27 June, 1967  a month before Goodfellows ATM appeared.
However, the patent for Goodfellows machine was lodged on 2 May, 1966, 14 months before Shepherd-Barrons ATM machine was first used.
That really stuck in my throat and I kicked up a fuss.
Shepherd-Barron is no longer alive but, in a 2005 interview, he was quite critical of his rival: I dont know him but its clear that the difference between Goodfellow and us was that we thought through the whole system concept and that was important to the banks who bought it.
The website ATMInventor.com says: Who invented the idea of an ATM?
We have to think it was James Goodfellow for holding a patent date of 1966. Who invented the ATM design we recognize today?
We think it was John D White in the US.
So after all these years, Goodfellow is  nally among a group of famous British inventors with John Logie Baird (the television), Alan Turing (the Turing machine), Sir Frank Whittle (the jet engine) and Sir Tim Berners-Lee (the World Wide Web).
Asked what he did with the 10 he received in the 1960s, Goodfellow says he thinks he blew it on a night out.
Our new international survey across 33 countries shows how wrong people around the world are about key social realities.
In Britain, people think that 43% of young adults aged 25-34 still live at home with their parents, rather than the actual 14%.
People also take mental shortcuts, where they take easily available information even if it doesnt quite  t the question.
Our study was mostly carried out through an online survey  and, in developing countries, this will be representative of a more wealthy, connected group rather than the general population.
What we  nd throughout the study is that people generalize from their own situations and forget how unrepresentative they are.
For Britain, worries are part of the explanation for peoples huge overestimates of how much the wealthiest own, how many young people are still living at home and what proportion of the population are immigrants (the guess is 25%, when it is really only 13%).
As part of his series, If Our Bodies Could Talk, Hamblin took on a no-showering challenge to examine the effect of over-cleansing the body.
He reduced the number of showers he had and did not use shampoo or soap when he had a shower.
Showering destroys these bacterial colonies; theyre completely destroyed by all our frequent rubbing and scrubbing.
And, when the bacteria washed off by soap return, they usually favour microbes which produce an odour  yes, showering too often may actually make you smell more.
However, when you stop showering and using soap, your skin goes through an initial (probably gross) adjustment period and, then, after that, the skin typically restores balance, oil production slows and healthy bacteria  ourish.
Reducing the frequency of showers (and the number of cleansing products used) has implications for our environment.
Thats 65 litres of clean, drinkable water that were  lling with soap and washing down the drain each day  sometimes more than once.
In a speech at the British Science Festival, Dr Paul Kelley of the Sleep and Circadian Neuroscience Institute at Oxford University said schools should stagger their starting times to work with the natural biological rhythms of their students.
In 2014, he published a paper in which he noted that, when children are around ten, their biological wake-up time is about 6.30am; at 16, this rises to 8am; and, at 18, someone you may think is just a lazy teenager actually has a natural waking hour of 9am.
The normal school starting time works for 10-year-olds but not for 16- to 18-year-olds.
A 7am alarm call for older teenagers, Kelley and his colleagues wrote in the paper, is the equivalent of a 4.30am start for a teacher in their 50s.
He says the solution is not to persuade teenagers to go to bed earlier.
Kelley says the working day should be more linked to our natural rhythms.
Should those in their 50s and above come in at 8am, while those in their 30s start at 10am and the teenage apprentice be encouraged to start at 11am?
Its very uplifting because its a solution that will make people less ill, and happier and better at what they do.
There would probably be fewer accidents because drivers would be more alert, he says.
It could mean the end of rush hour as people staggered their work and school-run times.
A later start to the day for many, says Kelley, is something that would bene t all people, particularly families.
The Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) will  nally have regulations on the commercial use of unmanned aircraft by June 2016.
But even short  ights from a mobile landing pad could cause serious logistical problems, he said.
Theyre not going to deliver from one uninhabited place to another uninhabited place; theyre going to deliver from a warehouse to the consumer, which will probably be an urban area or a suburban area, he said.
In those particular cases, there are going to be hazards that the vehicle is going to have to see.
Then, maybe theres construction equipment that wasnt there before but is there now.
Maybe GPS signals are blocked, in which case its going to have an incorrect idea about where it is.
Furthermore, you cant do everything with a 25kg aircraft, said Jay McConville, director of business development for unmanned systems at Lockheed Martin.
He is working on a program to allow drones to inspect infrastructure  pipelines, telephone lines, bridges and so on.
Weve developed an exploration algorithm where you draw a box around an area and it will  y around that area and look at every surface and then report back.
If you  y commercial airlines, they often say, Oh, a component has failed  we have to go back to the gate, Singh said.
Part of the solution, Singh said, is planning for every situation: If things fail, the vehicle has to do something reasonable.   
Maria is sitting on a black plastic chair in a community centre on a cold Tuesday afternoon waiting for someone to call her number.
When its her turn, Maria goes to pick up a brown paper bag  lled with essentials including pasta, eggs and corn akes, and can choose between butternut squash or carrots as this weeks vegetables.
Maria is the 34th client so far today at East Hampton Food Pantry, just streets away from some of the most expensive houses in the world.
The Hamptons are historic oceanfront towns and villages 100 miles from Manhattan.
The people who come here are rich and famous but we who live here are not, says Maria, who works 14-hour days in the summer cleaning mansions but often has no work at all in the winter.
She says some families with up to  ve children have to live in basements and still pay more than $1,000 a month in rent.
Lots of her friends cant pay for heating or medication and many would go hungry if the East Hampton Food Pantry didnt exist, she says.
Vicki Littman is chairperson of the East Hampton Food Pantry, which provided more than 31,000 food parcels in 2015.
Housing is the biggest cost in the Hamptons.
Cantwell says more than half the towns homes are empty for most of the year  this causes the population to go from 80,000 in August to 10,000 in the winter months.
Youve got to remember that this community used to be a farming and  shing community of people who lived off the land and the water  a real working-class community.
Its hard to grasp  OK, the summer is ending.
Vallone, who works cleaning pools and doing odd jobs on luxury estates, says that, if he saves well, his summer earnings can last until November.
There are worse things to do in life than stroll along Rios Copacabana beach in the sunshine on the way to watch a World Cup match, so it was perhaps not surprising that England fan Anthony McDowell from Liverpool was in a good mood.
He and half a dozen friends are among the thousands of supporters from around the world who have made the beach into a party zone of national colours and chants.
Some danced, some posed for photos, some drank, but mostly they just walked and talked football, waiting for the next game to begin on the nearby big screen.
The cheerful, largely peaceful mood was very different from the protests, transport chaos and stadium problems during the preparations for the World Cup.
But, now the football is under way, visiting supporters are determined to enjoy the experience.
The trip has not been without its problems.
And, they have been surprised that many bars do not have big screens for the games.
But, like many fans, they said they loved the atmosphere of this tournament, which has got off to a spectacular start on the pitch.
Everyone must have been thrilled by Robin van Persies extraordinary diving header for the Netherlands against Spain.
And, there have been lots of goals: 28 in the  rst eight games  almost three times as many as at the same stage in South Africa in 2010.
The Globo newspaper listed a number of problems in the 12 host cities.
The worst transport problems were in Natal, where bus drivers were on strike.
But, protests have diminished since the opening day, when small demonstrations took place in several cities and police used tear gas and pepper spray.
The tournament has made only a small mark on Sa_o Paulo, South Americas most populous city, but far away in Manaus  the remote Amazonian city where England played Italy  visitors said there was World Cup fever with brightly decorated streets and  ags on many cars.
But we were in Sao Paulo for four or  ve days before the opening match and you wouldnt have known until the last day that there was even a World Cup on.
McDonalds is the worlds biggest burger chain and a global emblem of American consumer capitalism.
McDonalds has revealed that worldwide sales dropped by 3.3% from 2013.
In Europe, sales are down by 4%, mostly because of problems in Ukraine and the anti-western mood in Russia.
But it is in the US, where McDonalds has around 40% of its restaurants, where the crisis is deepest.
Almost 60 years since Ray Kroc opened his  rst restaurant in Des Plaines, Illinois, consumers are losing their appetite for a Big Mac and fries.
McDonalds has seen 12 straight months of falling sales in its massive home market, with sales down 4.1% in the latest quarter.
The number of 19-to-21-year-olds visiting McDonalds once a month has fallen by 13% since 2011.
McDonalds is also widely perceived as less healthy than most of its rivals, especially Chipotle, with its antibiotic-free meat and locally sourced, seasonal produce  although local can mean 350 miles away.
was one question on the Our Food Your Questions website  this refers to the controversial beef  ller used for dog food that is sprayed with ammonia to make it  t for human consumption.
Yet, just as McDonalds has been losing the customers who will pay a bit more for food they think is fresher and healthier, it has also lost its edge in fast-food essentials: speedy service at low prices.
The expensive tag was unjusti ed, said Mary Chapman at food analysts Technomic.
A competitive breakfast menu, improved coffee and free wi-  have given McDonalds a broad appeal in the UK, said consultant Peter Martin, adding that 56% of British adults have visited a McDonalds restaurant at least once in the last six months.
Executives are promising to fight misconceptions about its food in its home market.
Only four out of McDonalds 14,000 US restaurants had so far tested build your own burger, he said.
Meanwhile, despite the declining sales, the chain continues to expand globally: by the end of 2014, it expects to have 1,400 new restaurants.
We think it will be number one for not just years but decades to come.   
The catching and killing of sharks longer than three metres began after what the state government called an unprecedented number of shark attacks on Western Australias coast.
Kate Faehrmann, of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, said from a protest in the state capital, Perth: Weve always said that this policy wont work.
This has demonstrated something about the national psyche; that, despite all the fear, thousands of people are coming out across the country to say, Thats their ocean.
Anthony Joyce, a surfer who once had his foot caught in a sharks mouth, said: The number of sharks they are going to kill is going to make no difference.
The state government has refused to say how many sharks have been killed, though there have been reports of sharks smaller than three metres being released after getting caught on drumlines,  oating drums  xed to the sea bed with bait hanging on hooks underneath them.
Conservationists say there is no evidence the cull will reduce the number of shark attacks on humans, because no previous cull has only used drumlines.
Researchers at the University of Western Australia say the increased number of shark attacks in the state is probably because the state has the fastest-growing population in Australia, not because of a rising number of sharks.
Richard Peirce, of the UK-based conservation charity, the Shark Trust, said that the cull would be ineffective and could bring more predators towards the coast.
People often dont consider that that drumlines are indiscriminate  even if monitored through the day, leaving the lines in at night has the potential to attract other predators into the area, attracted by those sharks and other species hooked and injured.
Worldwide, in 2012, there were 80 attacks by sharks, seven of which were fatal, compared to nearly 100m sharks killed by humans each year.
RSPCA Australia said in a statement that it believes the cull is unjusti ed.
Instead, it is consistent with a changing population and human behaviour; that is, there are greater numbers of people in the water, it said.
Youre advertising a problem that doesnt exist in a major way and youre deterring people from coming to Perth and your beautiful countryside around it.
What the job involves: A race engineer is the interpreter between the race-car mechanics and the driver, says race engineer Jamie Muir.
The engineer takes feedback from the driver, analyses the data and makes decisions about the set-up needed for maximum performance, then passes this on to the mechanics.
Ethical hacker Typical salary: A newly quali ed hacker can expect a minimum salary of 35,000 to 50,000.
What the job involves: A company will pay an ethical hacker to hack into its computer system to see how well it might resist a real attack.
What the job involves: Descending to the sea bed and searching for unexploded bombs, shells, grenades and landmines, then either safely recovering and collecting the weapons or securely disposing of them.
Quali cations: To dive offshore, you must have diving quali cations.
To be able to dispose of the bombs safely, youll also need an explosive- disposal quali cation and years of experience.
The job: Companies pay a social engineer to try to trick employees into giving them con dential information that allows the engineer to access sensitive company data or the companys computer network.
Quali cations: A private-helicopter-pilot licence, a commercial pilots licence and around 2,000 hours of experience  ying at low levels.
To succeed as a power line helicopter pilot, you need ... a steady hand and a cool head.
Butlers also suffer from isolation, cultural differences with their employer and having to work for people who arent always nice. 
Employees on zero-hours contracts often get no holiday or sick pay and have to ask permission before looking for additional work elsewhere.
And this needs to consider both the advantages and disadvantages for businesses and employees.
Retailer Sports Direct recently became the focus of controversy on zero-hours when it was reported that the company employs around 20,000 of its 23,000 staff on the contracts.
The retailers use of the contracts was followed by details of many other companies using the contracts, including cinema chain Cineworld and Buckingham Palace, which uses them for its 350 summer workers.
Pub group J D Wetherspoon has 24,000 of its staff  80% of its workforce  on zero-hours contracts.
Vidhya Alakeson, from the Resolution Foundation, added: If its true that there are around one million people on zero-hours contracts, then that would be a substantial portion of the workforce  this could no longer be dismissed as an issue affecting only a tiny minority.
Unions and poverty campaign groups have accused employers of pressuring staff into signing the contracts so that they can avoid their responsibilities and reduce staff bene ts.
They may give  exibility to a few, but the contracts favour the employers and make it hard for workers to complain.
Workers on zero-hours contracts are often only told how many hours they will work when weekly or monthly rotas are created, but are expected to be on call for extra work at short notice.
We believe zero-hours contracts are essential in our organization, as we are very weather-dependent, a spokeswoman said.
Its important to be able to reorganize staff rotas quickly to respond to the weather and zero-hours contracts allow us to do this.
Figures from the poll suggest that 17% of employers in the private sector use zero-hours contracts, considerably lower than the 34% of organizations in the voluntary sector and 24% in the public sector.
Industries where employers were most likely to have at least one person on a zero-hours contract were hotels, catering and leisure (48%), education (35%) and healthcare (27%).
