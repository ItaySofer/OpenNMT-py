They may not know who Steve Jobs was or even how to tie their own shoelaces, but the average six-year-old child understands more about digital technology than a 45-year-old adult, according to a new report.
The arrival of broadband in the year 2000 has created a generation of digital natives, Ofcom (which checks standards in the UK communications industries) says in its annual study of British consumers.
As a result of growing up in the digital age, they are developing completely different communication habits from older generations, even compared to the 16-to-24 age group.
800 children and 2,000 adults took Ofcoms digital quotient, or DQ, test, which attempts to gauge awareness of and self-con dence around gadgets from tablets to smart watches, knowledge of superfast internet, 4G mobile- phone networks and mobile apps.
Digital understanding peaks between 14 and 15 years old, with a DQ of 113, and then drops gradually throughout adulthood, before falling rapidly in old age.
The ways in which millennial children contact each other and consume entertainment are so different from previous generations that forecasters now believe their preferences to be a better indication of the future than the preferences of trendsetting young adults.
Two decades ago, teenagers spent their evenings monopolizing the home telephone line, talking about love affairs and friendships in conversations that lasted for hours.
Just 2% of childrens time using devices is spent emailing, compared to 33% for adults.
They spend 20% of their time viewing short video clips, for example on YouTube, or news clips on Facebook and other social sites.
Young adults aged 16 to 24 are big media consumers.
They call him the Robin Hood of the banks, a man who took out many loans worth almost half a million euros with no intention of ever paying them back.
Instead, Enric Duran gave the money to projects that created and promoted alternatives to capitalism.
After 14 months in hiding, Duran is unapologetic, even though his activities could put him in jail.
Im proud of what I did, he said in an interview by Skype from a secret location.
Meanwhile, constant growth was creating a system that created money out of nothing.
He spent two months in prison before being let out on 50,000 bail.
His actions, he said, were an important part of a worldwide debate on the economic crisis.
In his case, he said, he could offer banks the insight he got from years of obtaining bank loans fraudulently.
More than 25,000 kilos of dead  sh were collected afterwards and nearly 2,000 adult birds, chicks, eggs and nests were killed or destroyed.
Suddenly aware of Donanas status as the nations most important natural site, Spain decided to spend a further 360m, some of it EU money, on restoring the landscape.
However, the real body blow for conservationists has been the recent decision of the Andalucian government to reopen the Frailes mine that nearly destroyed Donana in 1998.
Donana already faces a large number of threats, but now they want to bring back the very cause of the disaster 16 years ago.
The crash of Spains banks in 2008 had a catastrophic effect on the region and unemployment in some parts of Andalucia is now more than 30%.
Reopening the mine would provide more than 1,000 jobs.
There are riches here, riches that are badly needed by local inhabitants, said energy spokesman Vicente Fernandez Guerrero.
People have been digging metals here since Roman times.
Fernandez said that the mine licence would only allow modern mining techniques, which avoid the creation of poisonous wet waste.
The plan has some support in the area, but it also has a lot of opposition.
Carlos Davila, who works for the Spanish Ornithological Society in Donana, was also alarmed at the plan.
This is a very, very bad idea, he said.
This is not surprising because this is a very special place.
The trouble is that Spain does not have the public resources it had 16 years ago.
This point is supported by Davila.
After the disaster, Spain realized that it had a place of real ecological importance and did a lot to clean it up and protect it, he added.
That movie will outline a rebel mission to steal the plans of the Death Star, a key part of the story in the  rst  lm in 1977.
In creating a multi-storyline, multi-character cinema universe around Star Wars, Lucas lm-Disney are copying the phenomenally successful series of  lms produced by Marvel Studios, which Disney also bought, in 2009.
Disney has increased the level of marketing savvy to a product that was already popular: Dergarabedian says the decision to make all six existing Star Wars  lms available on streaming services is a brilliant way to build the excitement for the new  lm and reinvigorate the idea of Star Wars in the minds of the fans.
Michael Rosser, news editor for Screen International, suggests that it is this shared universe of nostalgia that makes Star Wars the top  lm franchise.
Rosser is referring to the three  lms Lucas directed between 1999 and 2005  The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith  which were about the life of Luke Skywalkers father, Anakin, who becomes Darth Vader.
It shows the power of Star Wars that, although they were disappointing, the prequels still made a lot of money, said Rosser.
They also want people to go to the cinema at a time when lots are staying home for entertainment.
Meanwhile, Dergarabedian expects massive business when The Force Awakens reaches cinemas in December 2015.
We certainly expect a record opening for December and the  lm should make at least a billion dollars worldwide.
We may not yet be living in an age of  ying cars, as predicted in the 1985  lm Back to the Future II, but the rise of smartphones and other new technologies is creating a reality that is just as exciting and almost as far-fetched.
Experts agree that economic and demographic changes, technological advances, and environmental concerns are fundamentally changing transportation.
Theres a tighter connection between transportation and the economic health of cities and its impact on people.
Connectivity Ride-sharing services like Uber  taxis booked via smartphone  and apps like Waze, which uses real-time traf c data to  nd the quickest routes for drivers, are dramatically changing how people move around and affecting the way traf c moves through a city.
People still driving cars are dealing with less traf c thanks to Waze.
Companies are working to develop technology that will allow a vehicle to tell traf c control systems not only that it is present but also where it is going and how fast it is travelling.
But, even if driverless technology were ready to use now, it would take a long time to get fully automated because the average age of cars on the road is 11.5 years old.
DNA taken from the wisdom tooth of a European hunter-gatherer has given scientists a glimpse of modern humans before the rise of farming.
He was probably lactose intolerant and had more difficulty digesting starchy foods than the farmers whose diets and lifestyles changed in the first agricultural revolution.
But scientists may have overestimated the impact farming had on the human immune system, because tests on the hunter-gatherers DNA found that he already carried genes that boost the immune system.
The Spanish team started their work after a group of cave explorers found two skeletons in a deep and complex cave system high up in the Cantabrian Mountains of northwest Spain in 2006.
Carbon dating put the remains at around 7,000 years old, before farming arrived in Europe from the Middle East.
It is the first time researchers have got the complete genome of a modern European who lived before the Neolithic revolution.
The results suggest that blue eye colour came first in Europe and that the change to lighter skin happened throughout Mesolithic times.
You never see a reconstruction of a Mesolithic hunter-gatherer with dark skin and blue eyes, Lalueza-Fox said.
The Spanish team compared the genome of the hunter-gatherer to those of modern Europeans from different regions to see how they might be related.
Martin Jones, professor of archaeological science at Cambridge University, said the immunity genes were the most interesting result.
Two mothers in South Africa have found out that they are raising each others daughters after they were mistakenly switched at birth in a hospital in 2010.
But, while one of the women wants to correct the error and get her biological child back, the other is refusing to give back the girl she has raised as her own.
Henk Strydom, a lawyer for one of the mothers, described the swap as a travesty and tragedy that is unlikely to have a happy ending.
Strydom said: The man denied he was the father.
Here they have met their biological daughters  Strydom said of his client: She said there are resemblances to herself.
The woman became unhappy with the process and asked the childrens court to give her custody of her biological child, but the other mother refused.
She wants the baby back, but its four years later: you can understand that the other mother doesnt want to give up her baby, Strydom said.
The High Court in Pretoria has asked the University of Pretorias Centre for Child Law to investigate what will now be in the best interests of the children.
He said, at this point, he and his client do not want to sue the hospital or government health department, which is helping with the case and providing counselling.
The children and mothers will have clinical assessments and may be seen by a psychologist.
It is not the first child-swap case in South Africa.
He grew up on welfare and became a truck driver, whereas his biological brothers and sisters  and the boy brought up in his place  attended private secondary schools and universities.
There are many quirky solutions to help make our cities more livable, such as glow-in-the-dark trees, underground bike sheds and solar-powered bins.
City living has many upsides but a sustainable lifestyle is not always one of them.
Pollution, traf c and loss of green spaces are just some of the daily problems that city-dwellers have to deal with.
Take an empty car park, a small amount of money and a pot plant or two, and make yourself your own private park.
Subterranean storage Not all urban dwellers have cars.
Just seven metres wide, the cylindrical storage facility buries deep into the ground and can hold 204 bikes.
Glow-in-the-dark trees When most people think of trees that glow in the dark, Christmas trees usually come to mind.
The Dutch designer-artist has invented a bioluminescent plant.
The experimental technology joins DNA from luminescent marine bacteria with the chloroplast genome of a plant to create a glow like a jelly sh.
Few people probably notice the springiness beneath their feet.
The  oor has smart tiles that capture the energy from pedestrians footsteps and convert it into electricity.
Pavegen, the UK company who had the idea, has installed a similar system at Londons Heathrow Airport and other international locations.
Up to 50 metres high, these steel-framed supertrees not only have  owers growing up them  their metallic canopies absorb and disperse heat, too.
Eleven of the 18 trees also have solar panels on their branches. 
The Greek island of Agios Efstratios is so remote, so forgotten by the banks, the government and most of the modern world that there isnt a single ATM or credit-card machine on the island.
Residents have to make nine-hour round trips to the nearest big island to get cash and Greek visitors say they cant get hold of enough money to come.
Tourist numbers have reduced by 80% this year, said Mayor Maria Kakali, in an of ce in the village where she grew up, with a population of around 200 people.
Kakali has badgered the government and a major Greek bank into promising an ATM within weeks but she still feels it may be too late for this season on an island where tourism is the main source of income: We have almost no reservations in August, when usually we have people calling us up asking to  nd a room and we cant help them.
Everything, even milk or bread, has been bought and sold three or four times before it gets to us and everyone has to take a pro t, said Provatas Costas, a 58-year-old  sherman.
Lemnos has dozens of wild beaches, where you can swim and sunbathe virtually alone, a small nightlife scene and many cultural sites.
If taxes go up, even more young people will leave, warns Mayor Kakali, who has worked to improve education on the island to help keep it an attractive place for families.
There are too many festivals and there are not enough big acts to headline them.
So, with no big acts to headline, there are no big shows.
There is going to be a growth in events where it isnt just music but with poetry or books or magic shows.
There will be lots of small combination festivals that give something extra  not people standing around in a big  eld unable to go to the toilet because they might miss the band.
People dont seem to want to listen to an album any more.
And, most rock bands built their reputation on albums  they might take three albums to become really good at their art, to become great, but young people dont want that.
Goldsmith, 69, also revealed that he is working with Robin de Levita, the Dutch producer of the Whos 1970s rock musical Tommy, at a new 1,100-seat theatre in Wembley, London, where the  rst stage adaptation of the teen book and movie series The Hunger Games will be performed in June 2016.
He also gave the answer to a long-running rock n roll mystery: why Elvis Presley never performed outside North America.
Coldplay is probably the last one and that was ten years ago.

There are more southern white rhinos and black rhinos.
In 2007, 13 rhinos were killed by poachers in South Africa.
In 2014, 1,215 rhinos were killed for their horns in South Africa.
Cathal Redmond was swimming off the Greek coast and he was sure he had taken some great photos of colourful  sh with his  rst underwater camera.
He took the pictures while holding his breath underwater and blamed the limited time he had to set up the shots.
He decided to invent something to make that little extra time a reality and the result is his invention of the Express Dive  a re llable air storage device, which is held in the mouth and lets people swim underwater for two minutes.
So, rather than just go underwater and spend 30 seconds holding their breath, I wanted people to do a little bit more, says Redmond, 27.
The real problem is that scuba diving is very limiting.
It was during a  nal-year project for his product design degree that Redmond produced the Express Dive.
When above the surface, the unit sucks in air through a vent in the mouthpiece.
When air is no longer being taken in, the vent shuts off and, as the person dives, air is fed back via the mouthpiece.
The device can take in enough air for two minutes of diving and takes approximately the same amount of time to re ll.
He compares it to an extension of the lungs in that the user is taking a deep breath and then using it underwater.
It is an extension of the bodys ability to store air, he says.
Redmond says he has shown that the motor can compress two minutes worth of air into the unit and that the design can be held in the divers mouth.
But, with enough testing, Redmond is con dent he can get a fully working device that will not endanger swimmers underwater.
To anyone who thinks two minutes of air is no more than a very small improvement on snorkelling, Redmond says it could make a big difference underwater.
She last deactivated her account in December 2015 because she found the amount of personal information shared by others too heavy to deal with in addition to her work demands.
In my job, I spend a lot of time listening to peoples lives all day, every day and it started to feel so overwhelming to go on social media and see every single detail of everybodys lives, including people that I dont really have a relationship with, she said.
Im involved a lot with people in my work life and sometimes it felt like it was too heavy to do in my personal life also.

Hariharan Rajagopalan, 18, Boston, Massachusetts Rajagopalan, a student at Boston College, doesnt see any problem with not using social media.
He still has the account but he admits: I dont use it.

His billing, The Beale Street Blues Boy, was shortened to Blues Boy King and then to BB.
He was always ready to praise the musicians who had in uenced him  he would usually mention T-Bone Walker  rst.
He once explained that his guitar technique was partly based on his lack of skill: I started to bend notes because I could never play in the bottleneck style.
The 1965 album Live at the Regal, however, has become iconic, a turning point in the early listening of many younger musicians.
He had further R&B hits with blues numbers including How Blue Can You Get and Paying the Cost to Be the Boss, and, in 1969, he got near the top of the pop charts  where no blues artist had been for many years  with The Thrill Is Gone.
About a year and a half ago, he said in 1969, all of a sudden, kids started saying to me, Youre the greatest blues guitarist in the world.
Guided by his manager, Sidney Seidenberg, he went on international concert tours that took him to Japan, Australia, China and Russia.
He also gave concerts to prisoners at the Cook County jail in Chicago and at San Quentin, which led to his long involvement in rehabilitation programmes.
In 1990, King was diagnosed with diabetes and cut back his touring but his followers outside the US could still see him every year or two.
The celebrations for his 80th birthday, in 2005, included an award-winning album of collaborations with Clapton, Mark Knop er, Roger Daltrey, Gloria Estefan and others, tributes from musicians as diverse as Bono, Amadou Bagayoko and Elton John, and a goodbye tour that was not a goodbye at all.
Statistics suggest that vaping among smokers and recent ex-smokers, who are the vast majority of vapers, may already be declining.
Figures released in 2014 by the health charity Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) reveal that usage among adults in Britain of electronic cigarettes  which do not contain tobacco and produce vapour, not smoke  has tripled from 700,000 users in 2012 to 2.1 million in 2014.
However,  gures collated by the Smoking Toolkit Study, a research organization that provides quarterly updates on smoking trends, show vapings appeal may be declining.
The drop is described as statistically signi cant by Professor Robert West, who collates the  gures for the Toolkit.
Smokers are the key group for e-cigarette companies because seven out of ten vapers are smokers.
Weve only been studying vaping for just over a year, so its a short time period, but we are not seeing growth in the number of long-term ex-smokers or never smokers using e-cigarettes.
Vaping rates might change but, at this stage, it looks like theyre staying the same.
The fact that vaping has stopped growing in popularity in the UK seems to be at odds with what is happening in the US, where the technology has been promoted aggressively and where reports suggest it is growing in popularity.
Instead, e-cigarettes seem to be most popular among adults who want to quit.
While the  gures published this month by Smoking In England show that the use of electronic cigarettes by smokers has stopped rising, their data also shows the huge increase in use since May 2011, said James Dunworth, of ecigarettedirect.co.uk.
E-cigarettes behave like a sort of nicotine patch, West agreed.
The European Commission (EC) is looking at increasing taxes on e-cigarettes, which could have an impact on their popularity.
This may mean vapers will have to increase their usage to get the same effect, again something that may make e-cigarettes more expensive.
West suggested that policymakers should see e-cigarettes as an aid to stopping smoking and not have the same regulations for them as for smoking.
It just sounds like youre having a go at vapers and that undermines the public health messages were trying to get out.
Vienna is the worlds best city to live in, Baghdad is the worst and London, Paris and New York do not even enter the top 35, according to international research into quality of life.
Helena Hartlauer, 32, from Vienna, said she was not surprised at her citys top position.
The citys social democratic government has a long tradition of investing money in high-quality social housing, which makes Vienna less expensive than other major cities.
I live in a 100sq-metre apartment in a good area about 20 minutes walk from the city centre.
A similar apartment in London would cost over 2,000 and even more in New York, ranked 44th in the table.
You dont realize how safe Vienna is until you go abroad, said Hartlauer.
Vienna bene ted enormously from the fall of the Berlin Wall, becoming the gateway to Eastern European countries that often have historic connections to the former Austro-Hungarian empire.
Our big USP (unique selling point) is our geographical location, said Martin Eichtinger, Austrian ambassador to London, who lived in Vienna for 20 years.
The fall of the Berlin Wall helped make Vienna a hub for companies wanting to do business in Central Europe.
According to the World Bank, Austria has one of the highest  gures for GDP (gross domestic product) per person in the world, just behind the US and ahead of Germany and Britain, although below neighbouring Switzerland.
Mercer says Zurich in Switzerland has the worlds second highest quality of life but the Viennese say their city is far more fun.
Its a very fast growing, young and lively city, she added.
But, after an increase in budget  ights from British cities such as Manchester and Edinburgh, Vienna is becoming a more popular destination.
Vienna has ranked top in the last seven surveys, said Mercer.
It scores highly in a number of categories; it provides a safe and stable environment to live in, a high standard of public transport and good recreational facilities.
Paris has remained stable for several years but has, this year, dropped ten places, said Mercer.
Australian cities also do well in the survey, with Sydney 10th and Melbourne 15th.
All restaurants should have to publicly state their exact tipping policy.
Elle, 22, Edinburgh: We never know whether its fair Average tips: 20 per eight-hour shift I think they treat waiters best in ... France  I have three part-time catering jobs.
In restaurants, because a lot of customers add tips through card payments, the staff never see how much the tip is  so we dont know whether what we get is fair or not.
The system seems better in France, where they dont tip much but being a waiter is seen as a proper job, with job security and a decent income.
Or, when a member of the team does incredibly well, they dont get what theyve earned.
The managers should have ways to pay for broken glasses and plates without taking our tips.
I make around 20 a shift in tips but often I only get 10-15 of that money.
Id rather we earned a good basic wage (like in Australia) and didnt have to rely on tips.
Tom, Manchester: A big night of tips can help pay the rent Average tips: 40 per eight-hour shift I think they treat waiters best in ... Italy  Where I used to work, waiters kept 80% of cash tips and 40% of card tips.
The other 20% of cash went into a pot for the commis waiters and bar staff.
Its hard to say how much I earned a shift; maybe around 40.
They have got tipping right in Italy, where customers dont add a service charge but usually round up their bill so, if their meal is 19, they leave a 20 note and dont ask for change.
It brings stronger relationships with those you love, a stronger economy with more opportunities and a stronger society, wrote Zuckerberg.
School and university reunions are unnecessary  you already know whose career is going well, whether the perfect pair have split and youve seen pictures of your schoolmates babies.
A classmate from university who you havent seen for 15 years, a friend-of-a-friend from a party or a colleague youve never actually spoken to in person  they are all Facebook friends in the same way as your closest friend or your spouse or your mum.
Professor Robin Dunbar is famous for his research that suggests a person can only have about 150 people as a social group.
Ninety- one per cent post a photo of themselves, 71% post the city or town where they live, more than half give email addresses and a  fth give their phone number.
More than 80% of Facebook users list their interests, which allows brands to target them effectively.
But most younger users limit who can see their pro les, with 60% allowing friends only.
3 Facebook has created millions of jobs  but not in its own of ces Facebook provides indirect employment for people whose job it is to make Facebook work for their brand.
Marketers have an understanding of a brands customers like they have never had before.
The data available is extraordinary.
4 Facebook has been the tool to organize revolutions Organizing demonstrations and direct action has been revolutionized by Facebook.
Manchester Universitys Olga Onuch found Facebook had been the key way for reaching half of all the Euromaidan protesters in Ukraine.
Many of the people interviewed in Onuchs research said they relied on Facebook for the truth about what was happening  they dont trust traditional media.
For better or (often) worse, it is a place to  nd information on almost any ordinary person, who might suddenly  nd themselves at the centre of the days biggest news story.
In 2014, ten years after its launch, 56% of internet users aged 65 and older have a Facebook account.
This includes about 45% of all fruit and vegetables, 35% of  sh and seafood, 30% of cereals, 20% of dairy products and 20% of meat.
By 2050, food production will have to increase by 60%, compared to 2005 levels, to feed a growing global population.
The problem is global but appears in very different ways.
In wealthy countries, there are low levels of food loss but high levels of food waste, which means food is thrown away by consumers because they have purchased too much or by retailers who reject food because of strict standards of appearance.
The carbon footprint of food produced and not eaten is estimated at 3.3 gigatonnes of CO2  this means that, if food waste were a country, it would be the third highest emitter of greenhouse gases after the US and China.
About 30% of available agricultural land is used to grow or farm food that is subsequently wasted.
And more surface and groundwater is used to produce wasted food around the globe than is used for agriculture by any single country, including India and China.
