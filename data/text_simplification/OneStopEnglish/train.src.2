Brazil and Peru have lodged objections to a bid made by the US e-commerce giant for a prime new piece of cyberspace: .amazon.
Until now, the differences between commercial, governmental and other types of identity were easily distinguished in every internet address by .com, .gov and 20 other categories.
But these categories  or generic top-level domains (gTLDs) as they are technically known  are about to undergo the biggest expansion since the start of the worldwide web.
Amazon has applied for dozens of new domains, including .shop, .song, .book and .kindle.
Allowing private companies to register geographical names as gTLDs to reinforce their brand strategy or to profit from the meaning of these names does not serve, in our view, the public interest, the Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology said.
Brazil said its views were endorsed last month by other members of the Amazon Cooperation Treaty (Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Suriname and Venezuela).
Argentina has lodged an expression of its unhappiness that the US outdoor clothing retailer, Patagonia, is claiming a domain name that has been known far longer as a region of spectacular beauty that also has its own parliament.
Argentina rejects the .patagonia request for a new generic top-level domain, the government notes in an appeal.
Patagonia is a relevant region for the countrys economy because it has oil, fishing, mining and agriculture resources.
The first approved domain names should be in use before the end of 2013. 
But the Dutch capital may lose its reputation for tolerance over plans to dispatch nuisance neighbours to scum villages made from shipping containers.
The Mayor, Eberhard van der Laan, insists his controversial new 810,000 policy to tackle antisocial behaviour is to protect victims of abuse and homophobia from harassment.
The camps where antisocial tenants will be rehoused for three to six months have been called scum villages because the policy echoes proposals from Geert Wilders, the far-right populist, who last year demanded that repeat offenders be sent to a village for scum.
But Bartho Boer, a spokesman for the Mayor, denies that the plans are illiberal.
We want everyone to be who he and she is  whether they are gay and lesbian or stand up to violence and are then victims of harassment.
According to Boer, the villages are not for the regular nuisance between two neighbours where one has the stereo too loud on Saturday night but people who are extremely violent and intimidating, and in a clear situation where a victim is being repeatedly harassed.
Those deemed guilty of causing extreme havoc will be evicted and placed in temporary homes of a basic nature, including converted shipping containers in industrial areas of the city.
Dutch newspaper the Parool has pointed out that in the 19th century troublemakers were moved to villages in Drenthe and Overijssel, which rapidly became slums.
But Boer insists that the administration has learned from past mistakes and is not planning to house the antisocial together.
The city government anticipates moving around ten families a year into this programme, which starts in 2013.
The temporary dwellings will be heavily policed, but antisocial tenants will also have access to doctors, social workers and parole officers.
Brazils latest funk sensation, Anitta, has won millions of fans by taking the favela sound into the mainstream, but she is at the centre of a debate about skin colour.
Anti-discrimination campaigners and social commentators say the music industrys fastest rising star has had to sacrifice her blackness to make it into the predominantly white middleclass market.
The controversy was prompted by the publication of then-and-now photographs that show a dramatic lightening of Anittas skin tone since she signed a deal with Warner.
Jarid Arraes, a psychology student and blogger, wrote a post criticizing the latent discrimination in media and marketing that she felt Anittas image change represented.
She has now exploded into the public consciousness with an album and a huge hit single, Show das Poderosas, which topped the charts and attracted 52 million YouTube views.
Brazil  one of the last big countries in the world to ban slavery  has the largest population of African descent outside Africa, but race and ancestry are less important here than colour.
The vast majority of business and government executives are white, while most menial jobs are done by black and mixed-race workers.
Walk through Ipanema, Gvea or other upmarket districts and you are far more likely to see black nannies pushing strollers with white toddlers than a white nanny pushing a black child.
Sylvio Ferreira, a psychology lecturer at the Federal University of Pernambuco, believes Anitta has won the hearts of the middle class by taking a rebellious sound and making it tamer and more palatable to everyone.
Unlike more populous and accessible parts of the world, which have been mapped using a special camera mounted on a car roof, the Iqaluit project had mappers hiking the towns snow-packed roads and traversing little-known trails, some of which are made of ice and disappear in the brief summer months.
The Street View project, he said, follows in the footsteps of the English explorer Martin Frobisher, who in 1576 sailed into the bay where Iqaluit now sits while searching for the Northwest Passage, and the 1941 flight of Captain Elliott Roosevelt, a reconnaissance officer and son of the US President, which led to the site being chosen for a military airbase.
Another difficulty was how to situate many businesses and homeowners that have mail sent to the local post office rather than delivered to their address.
Sayani, 32, said the town would be able to use the maps as a promotional tool for those thinking of visiting or moving to the area.
It may also speed up planning decisions that will affect Iqaluits growth.
The controversial auction of a Banksy mural that disappeared from the wall of a north London shop in mysterious circumstances was dramatically halted just moments before it was due to go under the hammer.
Claire Kober, Leader of Haringey Council, wrote to Arts Council England and the Mayor of Miami, Toms Regalado, to ask them to intervene to stop the sale but it appears the decision to withdraw the item came from the gallery owners in consultation with their lawyers.
Although there are no legal issues whatsoever regarding the sale of lots six and seven by Banksy, FAAM convinced its sellers to withdraw these lots from the auction.
Critics have accused the auction house of dealing in stolen property but Thut insisted earlier in the week that the seller, who he described as a well known collector, was the rightful owner and that the sale was legal.
The second Banksy due to be auctioned, a 2007 artwork entitled Wet Dog that was removed from a Bethlehem wall and is estimated to be worth up to $800,000, disappeared from the auction houses online catalogue at lunchtime on Saturday, but Slave Labour was still listed for sale right up to the 3pm start time.
The vast fortunes made by the worlds richest 100 billionaires are driving up inequality and hindering the worlds ability to tackle poverty, according to Oxfam.
Oxfam said the worlds poorest could be lifted out of poverty several times over if the richest 100 billionaires would give away the money they made in 2012.
Bill Gates and Warren Buffett are among a group of 40 US billionaires who have pledged much of their wealth to aid projects, but there is little detail about the level of their annual donations.
In the report, The Cost of Inequality: How Wealth and Income Extremes Hurt Us All, published just before the World Economic Forum in Davos, the charity calls on world leaders to curb income extremes and commit to reducing inequality to at least 1990 levels.
She said studies show that countries suffer low levels of investment and growth as workers are forced to survive on a smaller share of total incomes.
She said: We can no longer pretend that the creation of wealth for a few will inevitably benefit the many  too often the reverse is true.
In China, the top 10% now take home nearly 60% of the income.
Chinese inequality levels are now similar to those in South Africa, which is now the most unequal country on Earth and significantly more unequal than at the end of apartheid.
Stocking said: We need a global new deal to reverse decades of increasing inequality.
As a first step, world leaders should formally commit themselves to reducing inequality to the levels seen in 1990.
She said closing tax havens, which the Tax Justice Network says hold as much as $31 trillion, or as much as a third of all global wealth, could yield $189bn in additional tax revenues. 
Dozens of alternatives have sprung up to take its place, from Facebooks and Apples own-brand instant messaging applications to independent start-ups such as WhatsApp and Kik (which is also Canadian).
Free to download and use, they use the internet to swap text messages, pictures, voice clips, stickers, and even videos in WhatsApps case, between most types of phones.
In an attempt to retain its following, BBM has been released on Android and Apple phones.
BBM claims 80 million monthly users after its upgrade, but WhatsApp has 300 million.
Other services expose BBMs limitations: unlike Skype and Viber, it does not yet offer video or voice calls; unlike Path, it does not do location sharing; there is no video sharing, as on iMessage; and the stickers (a more sophisticated version of the smiley face), adored by kids the world over, are also unforgivably absent.
Even the contacts and calendar sharing that BBM made possible on BlackBerry handsets have not migrated to the Apple and Android versions.
Photos uploaded to Instagram trigger a wave of comments and Snapchats pictures, which self-delete after ten seconds, have opened a world of other possibilities.
Yet as recently as 2011, BBM was so powerful it was credited with starting a revolution in Egypt; and, at the time of the London riots, it was a more urgent source of news than the television screen.
He manages a youth club in Stockwell, south London, an area with some of the highest levels of crime and economic deprivation in Britain.
Nearly 80% of young smartphone owners regularly use a social networking application, says the research firm Enders Analysis, but two-thirds use more than one.
Its a much more complex, multifaceted environment, says Benedict Evans, a digital media specialist at Enders.
All of these apps plug into your phone book and your photo library.
He keeps his BlackBerry for messaging, uses an iPhone over wi-fi to play games and makes phone calls on an HTC-branded Android phone.
Once I saw my mum on Facebook, I deleted my account.
Prosecutions after the riots put an end to that belief.
Bolivia had argued that the convention was 2 in opposition to its new constitution, adopted in 2009, which obliges it to protect native and ancestral coca as cultural patrimony and maintains that coca in its natural state  is not a narcotic.
The leaves reputedly provide energy and are said to have medicinal qualities.
The Bolivian move is inspirational and groundbreaking, said Danny Kushlick, Head of External Affairs at the Transform Drug Policy Foundation, which promotes drug liberalization.
However, the UNs International Narcotics Control 4 Board (INCB), which monitors implementation of the global drug treaties, has accused Bolivia of threatening the integrity of the international drug control regime.
The right of indigenous communities in South 6 Americas Andean region to chew coca leaf was removed in 1964 when Bolivia was under a dictatorship and it signed up to the convention.
But, under the terms of the agreement, Bolivia was given 25 years to implement the ban.
Bolivias re-accession could be blocked only if a third or more of the 184 countries that have signed up to the convention opposed its request.
Nancie Prudhomme, Projects Director at the 10 International Centre on Human Rights and Drug Policy, criticized the co-ordinated opposition to Bolivias demands.
The growing of coca leaves is legal and licensed 12 in Bolivia.
This is about changing our approach to management to allow for greater flexibility, less masculine cultures, more emphasis on outcomes rather than time in the office and greater transparency around performance and rewards.
Maria Miller, the Minister for Women and Equalities, said: The CMI figures are yet another damaging example highlighting that, in the world of work, women still lose out to their male counterparts and that the playing field is far from level.
However, the CMIs data did provide some evidence to support Millers contention that the overall pay gap is narrowing: the difference between the average salaries earned by male and female bosses has appeared to shrink, decreasing from an average of 10,060 in 2012 to 8,502 in the CMIs most recent figures.
A sub-set of 17,000 individual managers, whose salaries and bonuses have been tracked over a number of years, showed that male managers earnings are rising faster than womens for the first time in five years, with men enjoying total increases of 3.2% compared with 2.8% for women, when salaries and bonuses are combined.
Brazil experienced one of its biggest nights of protest in decades as more than 100,000 people took to the streets nationwide to express their frustration at heavy-handed policing, poor public services and high costs for the World Cup.
The unrest escalated during the night as a large crowd set several fires outside the legislative assembly, smashed the buildings windows and painted graffiti on the walls proclaiming Revolution, Down with Paes, down with Cabral [the mayor and state governor] and Hate police.
There must be something wrong with this country, said Nadia al Husin, holding up a banner calling on the government to do more for education.
In Belo Horizonte, police clashed with protesters who tried to break through a cordon around a football stadium hosting a Confederations Cup match between Nigeria and Tahiti.
In Porto Alegre, demonstrators set fire to a bus and, in Curitiba, protesters attempted to force their way into the office of the state governor.
Another global link was evident in the handful of demonstrators who wore Guy Fawkes masks, associated with Anonymous and the Occupy Wall Street protests.
Brazils demonstrations are being referred to as the vinegar revolution (after police arrested people for carrying vinegar to counter tear gas), as well as the 20-cent revolution (due to the bus price rise) and the Passe Livre (after the demand for free public transport).
Before the opening match in Brasilia, crowds of demonstrators were dispersed by riot police.
Footage showed frightened Japanese supporters rushing from the area holding their children, as the sound of shots  perhaps rubber bullets or tear gas  was heard.
Another protest march, near Rios Maracana Stadium, was met with a similarly heavy police response.
With the economy in bad shape and social unrest on the rise, she faces a serious political challenge, both now and in 2014, when Brazil will not only host the World Cup but also have a presidential election. 
Menthol and other flavours will be banned from 2022, but, in a blow to the UK government, MEPs decided that most electronic cigarettes, increasingly popular as alternatives to tobacco products, need not be regulated in the same way as medicines.
Health officials and the e-cigarette industry in Britain are seeking to clarify what this means  for instance, whether companies in the fast-expanding market face the same bans on sponsorship and promotion at sports events as tobacco firms.
But, in a statement, the DH said: We are very pleased to see the move towards tougher action on tobacco, with Europe-wide controls banning flavoured cigarettes and the introduction of stricter rules on front-of-pack health warnings.
However, we are disappointed with the decision to reject the proposal to regulate nicotine-containing products (NCPs), including e-cigarettes, as medicines.
The UK e-cigarette industry, which broadly welcomed the parliaments vote, said it was already in talks with the Advertising Standards Authority, but added that it would not be sensible, proportionate, reasonable or useful to ban all advertising.
They want to put the products, used by an estimated 1.3 million people in Britain by 2014, on the same legal basis as gums, patches and mouth sprays aimed at helping smokers to quit, but the industry says the expensive process of licensing would help force alternatives to tobacco off the shelves.
The MEPs voted to put health warnings on 65% of each cigarette pack, as opposed to a proposed 75%.
The UK government has delayed a decision on whether to follow Australia by introducing standardized packaging until there is evidence that such measures cut tobacco use.
We need to stop tobacco companies targeting young people with an array of gimmicky products and we need to make sure that cigarette packs carry effective warnings.
Martin Callanan, the Conservative MEP for North East England, said: Forcing e-cigs off the shelves would have been totally crazy.
These are products that have helped countless people stop smoking more harmful cigarettes and yet some MEPs wanted to make them harder to manufacture than ordinary tobacco.
Coal is likely to rival oil as the worlds biggest source of energy in the next five years, with potentially disastrous consequences for the climate, according to the worlds leading authority on energy economics.
New research from the International Energy Agency (IEA) shows that coal consumption is increasing all over the world  even in countries and regions with carbon-cutting targets  except in the US, where shale gas has displaced coal.
Maria van der Hoeven, Executive Director of the IEA, said: Coals share of the global energy mix continues to grow each year and, if no changes are made to current policies, coal will catch oil within a decade.
Coal is abundant and found in most regions of the world, unlike conventional oil and gas, and can be cheaply extracted.
China is the biggest coal importer, and Indonesia the biggest exporter, having temporarily overtaken Australia.
According to the IEAs Medium-Term Coal Market Report the world will burn 1.2bn more tonnes of coal per year by 2017 compared with today  the equivalent of the current coal consumption of Russia and the US combined.
When these are not equipped with special scrubbing equipment to remove chemicals, coal can also produce sulphur emissions  the leading cause of acid rain  and other pollutants such as mercury and soot particles.
Van der Hoeven said that, without a high carbon price to discourage the growth in coal use and encourage cleaner technologies such as renewable power generation, only competition from lower-priced gas could realistically cut demand for coal.
This has happened in the US, owing to the extraordinary increase in the production of shale gas in that market in the past five years.
The world faces the likelihood of an increased risk of climate change as a result of this runaway consumption of the highest carbon fossil fuel. 
Illegal downloading is a kind of moral squalor and theft, as much as reaching in to someones pocket and stealing their wallet is theft, says author Philip Pullman.
He is highly critical of internet users who think it is OK to download music or books without paying for them.
His article comes after music industry leaders met British Prime Minister David Cameron in Downing Street, where the issue of web piracy was discussed.
Pullman, writer of the His Dark Materials trilogy, says authors and musicians work in poverty and obscurity for years to bring their work to the level that gives delight to their audiences and, as soon as they achieve that, the possibility of making a living from it is taken away from them.
Casserly argues that there is much wrong with copyright, which was created in an analogue age.
She writes: By default, copyright closes the door on countless ways that people can share, build upon and remix each others work, possibilities that were unimaginable when those laws were established.
She says artists need to think creatively about how they distribute and monetize their work, quoting the science fiction writer Cory Doctorow, who said: My problem is not piracy, its obscurity.
The debate is a lively one and the scale of illegal downloading vast.
Ofcom has said 18% of internet users aged over 12 admit to having recently pirated content, and 9% say they fear getting caught.
Pullman writes in his article: The ease and swiftness with which music can be acquired in the form of MP3 downloads is still astonishing to those of us who have been building up our iTunes list for some time.
One thing to emerge from the Downing Street meeting was Camerons appointment of the Conservative MP Mike Weatherley to be his adviser on the subject.
We hope his influence and the prime ministers endorsement of copyright will be brought to bear on the approach of the UKs intellectual property office. 
So he tried crowdfunding on a US website, Indiegogo, which had recently opened up in the UK.
So popular was his campaign at the end of 2012 to entice donations from the public that within 40 days he had raised a colossal 400,000.
The LED light is powered by a dynamo driven by the descent of a 10kg bag of rocks.
The weight is attached to the light, lifted to a height of about 2m, and while it is allowed to slowly fall to the ground it will generate enough power for half an hour of light.
Hunt is preparing for production in China and will test the market again by delivering 1,000 of the lights to Africa before the full mass production of what he hopes will be millions of units.
He is one of a new wave of entrepreneurs turning to the fast-growing crowdfunding industry for finance.
Another new site is InvestingZone, which matches wealthy individuals with start-up entrepreneurs.
Indiegogo does not offer shares but allows users to offer perks for different levels of donation  those helping to fund Hunts innovative light not only got to feel good about helping the less well off but also got their own light.
It is the first time that finance has been fast, efficient and meritocratic, because it is not about How do I get access to the decision makers in that bank?
This is all about proving your worth to your customers and fans, getting them to validate your idea and fund it.
Even ideas that arent deemed worthy to get funding are worth testing, because you will have saved yourself a whole bunch of time finding out it wasnt a good idea and getting smarter faster, she says.
Five years on and it is raising about $2m a week for new businesses in start-up and growth stages.
There is no shortage of competitors, be it Kickstarter, Seedrs or Funding Circle, but, unlike rivals, says Ringelmann, Indiegogo is the only crowdfunder where anyone can launch a campaign.
The site levies a 4% fee for successful campaigns.
For those that fail to raise their target amount, users have the option of either refunding all money to their contributors at no charge or keeping all money raised but with a 9% fee.
A British woman, Lauren Pears, raised 100,000 to open a cat caf in London through the site.
Known as Lady Dinahs Cat Emporium, it is yet to open but is billed as somewhere people can come in from the cold to a comfortable wingback chair, a hot cup of tea, a book and a cat.
Weve seen campaigns that go to venture capitalists get rejected because the venture guys say, Great idea but no idea if the market actually wants it; it could be a gadget that no one cares about, said Ringelmann.
The entrepreneurs do an Indiegogo campaign  they dont even actually launch the project, but the campaign itself is enough market proof for venture capitalists to say there is a market for this.
It allows you to test your market, test your pricing, test your features, discover new revenue streams, get vital feedback, says Ringelmann.
With her Wall Street background and the experience of helping 100,000 businesses and services raise finance, Ringelmann has fine-tuned her advice for the budding entrepreneur.
I got frustrated with everyone trying to sell themselves as really active, always travelling or with a long list of hobbies, but no mention of children, Limal said.
But we dont make them specify how many children theyd like.
We had 50 sign-ups an hour when we launched in June and we are already hearing from couples who have met through the site and are now together.
More men have signed up than women (53% to 47%), with testimonials such as Its so lovely to be able to say this out loud and I finally dare to be honest about what I want.
The site has come at an opportune time for the country of five million people.
Hes keen to point out that this isnt just about baby farming: I want this to be about children and love.
There are plans to roll out the site in France and the UK later in 2013, but for now it is the Danes who are reaping the benefits.
He is now in Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, having flown down from Everest base camp that morning.
Cool is reflecting on a startling sequence of climbs completed over the course of the previous weekend.
For the first time since the late 1990s, there were fixed ropes on all three mountains.
Sixty years after Everest was first climbed, much of the coverage is looking back to Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay and their age of innocence from the modern era of commercialism and environmental degradation.
I hate to think, he says, but mentions the Swiss climber, Ueli Steck, who fled the mountain in April following what Cool terms an altercation with a crowd of Sherpas at Camp 2.
Hes technically brilliant but he had also taken his physical condition to an astronomic level.
Moro flew back to Everest on Tuesday at the controls of a highpowered helicopter to rescue a stricken climber at an altitude of 7,800 metres.
It was the highest rescue yet performed on Everest and highlights the exponential rise in helicopter flights in recent years.
By 2073, the infrastructure on the mountain could include a helipad on the South Col, bringing tourists breathing bottled oxygen.
Whether the Everest region can continue to cope with a booming tourism sector remains to be seen, according to mountain geographer and environmentalist, Alton Byers.
A new road for 4x4s is being built to Lukla to guarantee the flow of tourists and their money, but Byers is concerned that the rapid spread of the road network in Nepal is being done on the cheap, with disastrous consequences in terms of soil erosion and landslides.
Its the perfect laboratory for figuring out how to address some of these problems, like the impacts of climate change and tourism. 
It sounds like a headline from a health magazine; an unattainable promise on late-night satellite TV.
One group of moderately trained students performed an hour of steady cardiovascular exercise on a stationary bike five times a week.
The other group did a ten-minute warm-up on the bike, followed by four minutes of Tabata intervals, four times a week  plus one 30-minute session of steady exercise with two minutes of intervals.
After six weeks of testing, the group following Tabatas plan  exercising for just 88 minutes a week  had increased their anaerobic capacity by 28% and their VO2 max, a key indicator of cardiovascular health and maximal aerobic power, by 15%.
You cant go steady on a cross trainer, chewing gum and reading the latest issue of HELLO!
In the original plan the aim was to get to eight, but some only lasted six or seven.
I decided to do this because I often go on YouTube and, while I am honoured that people are doing it, some are doing it wrong because they dont realize the intensity you need to work at, says Tabata.
Runners, for instance, need a high level of running economy, which comes from skill acquisition and putting in the miles, says Scrivener, But they could effectively ease off the long runs and reduce the overall mileage by introducing Tabata training.
In the UK, 1.4m fewer users checked in in March, a fall of 4.5%.
Path, the mobile phone-based social network founded by former Facebook employee Dave Morin, which restricts its users to 150 friends, is gaining 1m users a week.
India has seen a 4% rise to 64m  still a fraction of the countrys population, leaving room for further growth.
Jefferies saw global numbers peak at 1.05bn a month in January, before falling by 20m in February.
The network has now lost nearly 2m visitors in the UK since December, according to research firm Nielsen, with its 27m total flat on a year before.
While smartphone minutes have doubled in a year, to 69 a month, that growth is not guaranteed to compensate for dwindling desktop usage.
The most significant is Facebook Home, software that can be downloaded onto certain Android phones to feed news and photos from friends  and advertising  directly to the owners locked home screen. 
form in the human brain, Susumu Tonagawa, a neuroscientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and his team encoded memories in the brains of mice by manipulating individual neurons.
These records, called engrams, are encoded in physical and chemical changes in brain cells and the connections between them.
According to Tonagawa, both false and genuine memories seem to rely on the same brain mechanisms.
The next day, the same mice were placed in a second chamber and given a small electric shock, to encode a fear response.
At the same time, the researchers shone light into the mouse brains to activate their memories of the first chamber.
That way, the mice learned to associate fear of the electric shock with the memory of the first chamber.
The mice froze, demonstrating a typical fear response, even though they had never been shocked while there.
A similar process may occur when powerful false memories are created in humans.
So, just like our mouse, it is quite possible we can associate what we happen to have in our mind with bad or good high-variance ongoing events.
We hope our future findings along this line will further alert legislatures and legal experts to how unreliable memory can be.
Chris French, head of the Anomalistic Psychology Research Unit at Goldsmiths, University of London, is a leading researcher in false memories in people.
He said that the latest results were an important first step in understanding their neural basis.
Memory researchers have always recognized that memory does not, as is often assumed, work like a video camera, faithfully recording all of the details of anything we experience.
He cautioned that the false memories created in the mice in the experiments were far simpler than the complex false memories that have generated controversy within psychology and psychiatry  for example, false memories of childhood sexual abuse, or even memories for bizarre ritualized satanic abuse, abduction by aliens, or past lives.
Such rich false memories will clearly involve many brain systems and we are still a long way from understanding the processes involved in their formation at the neuronal level, said Professor French.
Mark Stokes, a neuroscientist at Oxford University, said the experiments were a tour de force but that it was important to put them into perspective.
Now that we can reactivate and change the contents of memories in the brain, we can begin asking questions that were once the realm of philosophy, said Steve Ramirez, a colleague of Tonagawas at MIT.
These are the once seemingly sci-fi questions that can now be experimentally tackled in the lab.
Whatever means are used to implant false memories, we need to be very aware of the ethical issues raised by such procedures  the potential for abuse of such techniques cannot be overstated. 
Sir Alex Ferguson will retire as Manchester United manager at the end of the season in the 27th year of a tenure that has made him the most successful manager in British football.
Regarding his decision, Ferguson said: The decision to retire is one that I have thought a great deal about and one that I have not taken lightly.
It was important to me to leave an organization in the strongest possible shape and I believe I have done so.
Our training facilities are amongst the finest in global sport and our home, Old Trafford, is rightfully regarded as one of the leading venues in the world.
Going forward, I am delighted to take on the roles of both director and ambassador for the club.
In my early years, the backing of the board, and Sir Bobby Charlton in particular, gave me the confidence and time to build a football club, rather than just a football team.
Over the past decade, the Glazer family have provided me with the platform to manage Manchester United to the best of my ability and I have been extremely fortunate to have worked with a talented and trustworthy chief executive in David Gill.
It is understood he gathered the players in the first-team changing room shortly after they arrived for training on Wednesday morning.
I will always cherish the wonderful memories he has given us, like that magical night in Moscow.
We knew that his retirement would come one day and we both have been planning for it by ensuring the quality of the squad and club structures are in first-class condition.
Alexs vision, energy and ability have built teams  both on and off the pitch  that his successor can count on as among the best and most loyal in world sport.
It has been the greatest experience of my working life being alongside Alex and a great honour to be able to call him a friend.
First-team coach Ren Meulensteen revealed how Ferguson broke the news to his backroom staff on Wednesday morning.
He called us into his office and told us what decision he had taken.
Not nearly enough exercise classes have a tea break halfway through.
Despite an excruciating trapped nerve in one leg and a knee in need of replacement, she looks as though she could go on for hours.
But, on the afternoon I visit Allens class at a church hall in Saltburn-by-the-Sea near Middlesbrough, slices of fruitcake are being passed around during the break.
Allen, a former volunteer with the Red Cross, has been leading classes in the north-east seaside town for 45 years.
Not particularly sporty at school, she started playing the piano for a keep-fit class during the second world war  just for something to do during the blackouts, really  and eventually took over in her 40s when the previous instructor retired.
At its peak, Allens class had more than 18 regulars, each paying 1 a time.
Allen thinks her good health is largely down to keeping busy, especially since her husband Joe died in 1997.
I just cant stop, she says, phoning me a few days after the interview to read out a ditty she has written about the joys of exercise.
She happily recalls a doctor who saw her for the first time a few years back, who said she couldnt possibly be more than 78: I said, Thank you, doctor.
There will not be enough water available on current croplands to produce food for the expected nine-billion population in 2050 if we follow current trends and changes towards diets common in western nations, the report by Malik Falkenmark and colleagues at the Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI) said.
There will be just enough water if the proportion of animal-based foods is limited to 5% of total calories and considerable regional water deficits can be met by a reliable system of food trade.
Dire warnings of water scarcity limiting food production come as Oxfam and the UN prepare for a possible second global food crisis in five years.
Animal protein-rich food consumes five to ten times more water than a vegetarian diet.
Other options to feed people include eliminating waste and increasing trade between countries in food surplus and those in deficit.
Nine hundred million people already go hungry and two billion people are malnourished in spite of the fact that per-capita food production continues to increase, they said.
The report is being released at the start of the annual world water conference in Stockholm, Sweden, where 2,500 politicians, UN bodies, non-governmental groups and researchers from 120 countries meet to address global water supply problems.
Competition for water between food production and other uses will intensify pressure on essential resources, the scientists said.
He is now 36 and his life can be divided into two distinct phases.
Eventually he was arrested for serious drug-related offences and was sent to prison for 12 years.
They work with the police, the probation service and other, voluntary organizations to help those who feel trapped and frightened in the violent criminal gangs that operate across London.
For Smart, the extraordinary journey from gang member to mentor began when he witnessed, from within, a prison system that was so obviously failing its inmates.
I was talking to the inmates and they knew what needed to be changed in their lives, but the problem is that the prison system only deals with the index offence.
One guy had a 300-a-week cocaine habit, which he funded through burglary.
From there he developed what he calls his own little plan to run his own scheme once out of prison  using the experience of ex-offenders to help others reject the revolving door of prison life.
But overall he is highly critical of a disjointed government approach that believes that, once the leader of a gang is arrested, the problem is solved.
It is often they who are charged with doing the street dealing or even the stabbing, he says.

But, if the UNESCO World Heritage Site that straddles the equator is exploited for oil, as the Congolese government and exploration firm SOCO International are hoping, it could lead to devastating pollution and permanent conflict in an already unstable region, says the conservation body.
SOCO International is the only company seeking to explore inside the boundaries of the Virunga park.
SOCO insist that their operations in Congo would be confined to an area in the park known as Block V, and would not affect the gorillas.
However, Raymond Lumbuenamo, country director for WWF Democratic Republic of the Congo, based in Kinshassa, said that security in and around the park would deteriorate further if SOCO went ahead with its exploration plans.
Virungas rich natural resources are for the benefit of the Congolese people, not for foreign oil prospectors to drain away.
The park, Africas oldest and most diverse, is home to over 3,000 different kinds of animals, but is now heavily populated with desperately poor people, many of whom fled there after the Rwanda massacre in 1994.
In all, the park could support in the region of 45,000 permanent jobs.
In addition, people around the world could get an immense value from simply knowing that the park is well managed and is safe for future generations, says the report.
Nobody knows which came first: the economic crisis tearing Greece apart or shisha, the drug now known as the cocaine of the poor.
As drugs go, it is the worst.
It burns your insides, it makes you aggressive and ensures that you go totally mad, said Maria, a former heroin addict.
For Charalampos Poulopoulos, the head of Kethea, Greeces pre-eminent anti-drug centre, shisha symbolizes the depredations of a crisis that has led to record levels of destitution and unemployment.
It is, he said, an austerity drug  the response of dealers who have become ever more adept at producing synthetic drugs designed for those who can no longer afford more expensive highs from such drugs as heroin and cocaine.
The crisis has given dealers the possibility to promote a new, cheap drug, a cocaine for the poor, said Poulopoulos at a centre run for addicts in Exarcheia, the anarchist stronghold in Athens.
Across Greece, the byproducts of six straight years of recession have been brutal and cruel.
Depression, along with drug and alcohol abuse, has risen dramatically.
Prostitution  the easiest way of financing drug addiction  has similarly skyrocketed.
Desperation is such that many women agree to engage in unprotected sex because that way theyll make more money, said Eleni Marini, a British-trained psychologist with Kethea.
Shisha has been linked to a very intense sexual drive but it attacks your ability to think straight and were seeing a lot more pregnancies among drug addicts who engage in prostitution.
Since the outbreak of the crisis in 2009, Kethea has lost 70 of its 500 staff.
The cuts come despite studies showing that, for every euro invested in programmes such as Kethea, the state saves about 6 in costs to the criminal justice and healthcare systems.
Throughout a momentous day at Liverpools Anglican Cathedral for the families of the 96 people who died so needlessly at Sheffield Wednesdays Hillsborough football ground, one phrase dominated above all else: the truth.
In a concerted campaign  led, the panel found, by the Chief Constable, Peter Wright  the South Yorkshire Police put out their story that drunken supporters or those without tickets had caused the disaster.
The victims had their blood tested for alcohol levels.
It was done to remove criticism of the police, Scraton said.
In that landscape of neglect, it was the mismanagement of the crowd by the police, commanded by an inexperienced Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield, that was the prime cause of the disaster.

He said that the basic premise behind Nordic Food Lab was: Nothing is not edible.
Insects are critical to life on Earth and, with more than a million species, are the most diverse group of creatures on the planet, yet they are misunderstood, hated and often put to death by humans just because they are there.
The increase will mean more pressure on agricultural land, water, forests, fisheries and biodiversity resources, as well as nutrients and energy supplies.
Edible insects emit fewer gases, contain high-quality protein, vitamins and amino acids, and have a high food-conversion rate, needing a quarter of the food intake of sheep, and half of pigs and chickens, to produce the same amount of protein.
They emit fewer greenhouse gases and less ammonia than cows and can be grown on organic waste.
Zimbabwe has a thriving mapone caterpillar industry and Laos was given nearly $500,000 by the FAO to develop an insect-harvesting project.
A study by FoodServiceWarehouse.com suggested that swapping pork and beef for crickets and locusts could help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 95%.
But perhaps the fairest thing about eating worms and insects comes when we are dead  then they get a chance to nibble their own back.  
Consumers who believed they had eaten prized kuruma shrimps, for example, were told they had in fact dined on the much cheaper black tiger version.
The Prince Hotel in Tokyo was forced to come clean after a diner complained in a blogpost that a scallop dish he had ordered contained a similar, but cheaper, type of shellfish.
Its report scared Hankyu-Hanshin and other hoteliers into admitting that they, too, had hoodwinked diners who believed they were paying high prices for premium ingredients.
The Hotel Okura chain  whose guests have included Barack Obama  confessed myriad sins, including injecting beef with fat to make it juicier and incorrectly describing tomatoes as organic.
The list of fraudulent ingredients continues to grow: orange juice from cartons sold as freshly squeezed; Mont Blanc desserts topped with Korean chestnuts instead of the promised French ones; bought-in chocolate cream masquerading as home-made; imported beef sold as high-end wagyu.
Even the governments top spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, was moved to comment on the scandal.
These incidents have surfaced one after the other and this inappropriate labelling has resulted in the loss of trust among consumers, he told reporters.

In his shared office space in San Francisco  a cool, converted warehouse in the heart of startup land, filled with twentysomethings  he quotes Sun Tzus The Art of War and points out that even tiny armies can sometimes beat mighty forces.
The leading manufacturers are lining up to work with him, he says, because they have the technology, they just struggle to sell it.
He certainly has the confidence of Jobs, although, with a thick Japanese accent, he sometimes struggles to make himself understood, a fact that may have contributed to Telepathy Ones conception.

So far in 2012, the area has received almost one million holidaymakers  more than 23,000 of them from outside India.
Its a source of frustration, admitted Abdullah, who has been in charge of Indias most sensitive state since the start of 2009.
Youve had British citizens killed more recently in countries that you still havent stopped people from visiting.
Youve lost them in Spain, in Bali; tell me where you havent lost them, said Abdullah.
There is still a possibility that al-Qaida could do something stupid like they have done in the past, but we havent stopped Indians from travelling to London.
There is no reason to single out Jammu and Kashmir, or even Srinagar, as an unsafe destination.
Germany relaxed its guidelines for those thinking of travelling to the region in 2011.
But this time at the independence celebrations there was no trouble.
Abdullah insists tourists are safe in the state, as long as you take the sort of precautions that one normally would.
In other words, do not go trekking near the border that separates the Indian and Pakistani controlled parts of J&K.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge won the first round in their battle for privacy on Tuesday when a French magazine was banned from selling or reusing images taken of the couple at a private chateau in Provence.
But the war is far from over as French prosecutors must now decide if criminal proceedings are to be brought against the magazine editor and the photographer or photographers responsible for taking pictures of the duchess sunbathing topless while on holiday in the south of France.
The magistrates ruled that every photograph published in France by Mondadori, the publishing company owned by former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, in future would carry a fine, also of 10,000 per breach.
But the ruling refers only to the 14 pictures that have already been published.
A source said: They always believed the law was broken and that they were entitled to their privacy.
Maud Sobel, a lawyer for the royal couple in Paris, described it as a wonderful decision, adding: Weve been vindicated.
Also on Monday, the Mondadori-owned Italian celebrity magazine Chi rushed out a special edition with 26 pages devoted to the candid photos of the future queen.
The court on Friday rejected claims from the governments lawyers that too much time had elapsed since the seven-year insurgency in the 1950s, and it was no longer possible to hold a fair trial.
Human rights activists in Kenya estimate more than 5,000 of the 70,000-plus people detained by the British colonial authorities are still alive.
The Foreign Office acknowledged that the ruling had potentially significant and far-reaching legal implications, and said it was planning to appeal.
In this case, that period has been extended to over 50 years despite the fact that the key decision makers are dead and unable to give their account of what happened.
They had been sitting silently with their supporters in a sun-scorched garden and reacted with joy when the word came, hugging, dancing and eventually raising their hands to the sky to pray.

McCombe said in 2011 that there was ample evidence  that there may have been systematic torture of detainees.
Among those who are known to have been watching the case closely are a number of veterans of the Eoka insurgency in Cyprus in the 1950s.
Any Cypriot claimants would be able to rely not only on British documentation, but upon the archives of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva.
Those files are kept secret for 40 years, and then opened to public scrutiny.
Relatives of 24 unarmed rubber plantation workers massacred by British troops are currently fighting through the British courts for a public inquiry.
Many former prisoners of the British in Aden may also have claims against the British government, although, as Aden is now part of Yemen, British lawyers may have difficulty making contact with potential clients there. 
He has been able to cope with the stigma of being HIV positive  widespread in Liberia  and he was able to access antiretroviral medication, provided by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and distributed by the Liberian government.
But meat and fish  expensive, luxury products in Liberian markets but essential sources of protein  remained elusive.
Pate K Chon, a counsellor who works with HIV sufferers in Liberia, provided an unlikely solution.
Since watching a documentary about a fish farm in Thailand several years earlier, she had thought of setting up a similar project in Liberia, enabling HIV sufferers to have work and also access a stable source of protein.
So many of the people I work with dont have the means to have a balanced protein diet and fish is such a clean source of protein  it doesnt cause health problems like other sources, and it is something we can farm.
Chon, founder of a faith-based NGO, began building a pool in which to farm fish.
The project has now grown into the Grow2Feed Liberia Fish Farm, with 12 tanks, which, when fully stocked, will each have 5,000 fish  providing up to 200,000 fish per year, serving a community of 1,200 predominantly HIV-positive people, including King and his family.
They can use those fish to feed themselves and to sell in the market so that they get money to buy other staple items.
The fish farm gives these people with HIV a way of getting back into society  now they are bartering and trading with people in the market every week.
According to Liberias demographic health survey, 1.5% of Liberias 3.5 million people are HIV positive, with 60% of those women or girls.
Research has shown they need much higher levels of protein to prevent their health from deteriorating and to allow healthy growth.
Fish farming is absolutely viable in Africa, said Paul White, owner of the HydroFish fish farm in Ivory Coast, which produces 3,000 tonnes of fish each year.
Some critics are sceptical of farmed fish, citing inbred fish and high levels of toxins.
But Sheehy said good practice mitigated these problems.
Police and intelligence agencies around the world have, for almost 100 years, relied on lie detectors to help convict criminals or unearth spies and traitors.
By contrast, the new method developed by the researchers has performed well in experiments.
The basic premise is that liars fidget more and so the use of an all-body motion suit  the kind used in films to create computer-generated characters  will pick this up.
The suit contains 17 sensors that register movement up to 120 times per second in three dimensions for 23 joints.
Anderson said: The takeaway message is that guilty people fidget more and we can measure this robustly.
Anderson added that the research had a special significance at this time, against the background of the US Senate report on torture by the CIA.
We have known for a long time that torture does not work, he said.
It records changes in pulse, blood pressure, sweating and breathing to ascertain whether a subject is lying.
Some were interviewed about a computer game Never End, which they played for seven minutes, while others lied about playing it, having only been shown notes about it.
Some were asked to bring the wallet to a lost-and-found box while others hid it and lied about it.
Overall, we correctly classified 82.2% (truths: 88.9%; lies: 75.6%) of the interviewees as either being truthful or deceptive based on the combined movement in their individual limbs, the report says.
It turned out that liars wave their arms more but, again, this is only at the 60% level that you can get from a conventional polygraph.
That turns out to tell truth from lies over 70% of the time and we believe it can be improved still further by combining it with optimal questioning techniques.
The use of all-body suits is expensive  they cost about 30,000  and can be uncomfortable, and Anderson and his colleagues are now looking at low-cost alternatives.
These include using motion-sensing technology from computer games, such as the Kinect devices developed by Microsoft for the Xbox console.
That in itself is justification for the enormous project that the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) in Seattle has led over the past five years, involving nearly 500 researchers, to assess the global burden of disease.
Knowing how many children die and from what cause enables the world to focus its efforts and resources on keeping them alive.
In the absence of death registries or medical records, they have been willing, for instance, to take evidence from verbal autopsies  deciding the cause of death by an interview with the family.
The way I was taught as a doctor and everybody else is taught is that, in malarial areas, you become semi-immune as an adult, said Dr Christopher Murray, IHME Director and one of the founders of the Global Burden of Disease project.
We need to be very careful in assessing the validity [of the figures], said Colin Mathers, a senior scientist in the Evidence for Information and Policy Cluster.
His colleague Dr Tiers Boerma, Director of the WHO Department of Health Statistics and Informatics, added: People should understand that some of the numbers are very different and the WHO cant jump with any academic publication that states a different number.
However, said Mathers, the fact that IHME has pushed the envelope with some of these analyses is stimulating.
One of the main themes, said Murray, was incredibly rapid change in the leading causes of death and the pace of that change is a lot faster than we expected it to be.
Reduced fertility and longer life expectancies have meant a rise in the mean age of the worlds population in a decade, from 26 years old to almost 30.
It has been dramatic in Latin America, for instance, where countries like Brazil and Paraguay had life expectancy of below 30 in 1970 and almost 64 in 2010.
That is a 35-year increase in the mean age of death over four decades.
In a place like Brazil, the speed of change is so fast that most institutions are ill-equipped to deal with it, Murray said.
The second theme, entwined with it, is the shift outside Africa from communicable diseases and the common causes of mother and baby deaths to what are sometimes termed lifestyle diseases, such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes and cancer  some of which have significant genetic triggers.
That shift has been particularly marked in Latin America, the Middle East and south-east and even south Asia, he said.
They were mental health problems such as anxiety and depression, musculoskeletal disorders such as arthritis and lower back pain  complained of in every country in the world  anaemia, sight and hearing loss and skin disease.
Firstly, when on Mars their bodies will have to adapt to surface gravity that is 38% of that on Earth.
It is thought that this would cause such a total physiological change in their bone density, muscle strength and circulation that voyagers would no longer be able to survive in Earths conditions.
Secondly, and directly related to the first, they will have to say goodbye to all their family and friends, as the deal doesnt include a return ticket.
He told The Guardian that the applicants so far ranged in age from 18 to at least 62 and, though they include women, they tended to be men.
I could be one of the pioneers, building the first settlement on Mars and teaching people back home that there are still uncharted territories that humans can reach for.
The prime attributes Mars One is looking for in astronaut-settlers are resilience, adaptability, curiosity, ability to trust and resourcefulness, according to Kraft.
For instance, water can be extracted from ice in the soil and Mars has sources of nitrogen, the primary element in the air we breathe.
The broadcasting revenue from the London Olympics was almost enough to finance a mission to Mars, Lansdorp said, in an interview with ABC News.
The aim is to establish a permanent human colony, according to the companys website.
The first team would land on the surface of Mars in 2023 to begin constructing the colony, with a team of four astronauts every two years after that.
Mars One believes it is not only possible, but imperative that we establish a permanent settlement on Mars in order to accelerate our understanding of the formation of the solar system, the origins of life and, of equal importance, our place in the universe, it says. 
The balls have dropped down the chute and all six numbers match, so its time to buy that Audi, book the holiday in the US and phone the estate agent.
At least, thats what most lottery millionaires do, according to an analysis of spending and investment by jackpot winners.
Since its launch in 1994, the lottery has created 3,000 millionaires who have won more than 8.5bn in total, at an average of 2.8m each.
The trickle-down effect means that between them they have created a further 3,780 millionaires among their children, family and friends, according to the authors of the study, Oxford Economics.
Most winners (59%) give up work straight away, but 19% carry on doing the day job and 31% do unpaid voluntary work.
The good news for the economy is that 98% of winners spending remained in the UK.
Winners have contributed almost 750m to gross domestic product (GDP), and generated more than 500m in tax receipts for the Exchequer.
Most winners (82%) changed their main residence, spending an average 900,000.
The new home is likely to come with a hot tub, with almost a third (29%) putting that on their shopping list.
A walk-in wardrobe was a must for 28%, almost a quarter (24%) opted for a property behind electric gates, and 22% had a games room, with 7% installing a snooker table.
Andy Logan, author of the report, said: The effect of a win spreads much further and wider than we anticipated.
Not only does it transform the lives of friends and family, but each win has a measurable effect on the UK economy, especially with so much of it being spent in the UK.
When the Taliban sent a gunman to shoot Malala Yousafzai in October 2012 as she rode home on a bus after school, they made clear their intention: to silence the teenager and kill off her campaign for girls education.
Nine months and countless surgical operations later, she stood up at the United Nations on her 16th birthday on Friday to deliver a defiant riposte.
She listened quietly as Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary-general, described her as our hero, our champion; and as the former British prime minister and now UN education envoy, Gordon Brown, uttered what he called the words the Taliban never wanted her to hear: happy 16th birthday, Malala.
The event, dubbed Malala Day, was the culmination of an extraordinary four years for the girl from Mingora, in the troubled Swat valley of Pakistan.
By 11, she was showing exceptional determination, calling personally on the US special representative to Pakistan, Richard Holbrooke, to use his influence to combat the Talibans drive against education for girls.
By 14, she was on the radar of Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who put her forward for the International Childrens Peace Prize, and, by 15, she became the youngest Nobel Peace Prize nominee in history.
Malala responded to the violence of the Taliban with her own countervailing force: words against bullets.
There was one other unstated allusion to the horror of her past: she wore a white shawl belonging to a woman who was also targeted by extremists but who, unlike Malala, did not survive to tell the tale: Benazir Bhutto, the former prime minister of Pakistan.
She cited the attack in June on a hospital in Quetta, capital of Baluchistan, and killings of female teachers in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The Stand with Malala petition, calling for education for the 57 million children around the world who do not go to school, has attracted more than four million signatures  more than a million having been added shortly after Malalas speech.
She need not have worried. 
Galina Zaglumyonova was woken in her flat in central Chelyabinsk by an enormous explosion that blew in the balcony windows and shattered clay pots containing her few houseplants.
When she jumped out of bed she could see a huge vapour trail hanging in the morning sky and hear the wail of car alarms from the street below.
Officials put the number of people injured at almost 1,200, with more than 40 taken to hospital  most as a result of flying glass shattered by the sonic boom created by the meteorites descent.
The meteorite entered the atmosphere travelling at a speed of at least 33,000mph and broke up into chunks between 18 and 32 miles above the ground, according to a statement from the Russian Academy of Sciences.
Tatyana Bets was at work in the reception area of a hospital clinic in the centre of the city when the meteorite struck.
First we noticed the wind, and then the room was filled with a very bright light and we could see a cloud of some unspecified smoke in the sky, she said.
She said a nearby dormitory building for college students was particularly badly affected and many of the students were brought in suffering from fright.
The total cost of the damage in the city was being valued at in excess of one billion roubles (20m).
Rumours and conspiracy theories, however, swirled in the first few hours after the incident.
The ultranationalist leader of Russias Liberal Democrat party, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, said it was not a meteorite but military action by the United States, echoing much of the speculation voiced on amateur film footage.
Some were quick to take advantage of the confusion.
Enterprising people were offering lumps of meteorite for sale through internet sites within a few hours of the impact.
President Vladimir Putin and the Prime Minister, Dmitry Medvedev, were informed about the incident, and Putin convened a meeting with the head of the Emergency Situations Ministry.
There comes a time in some mens lives when the days seem darker, mortality more certain, and the only sensible response is to blow the life savings on a sportscar.
Radical and often ill-advised changes in lifestyle have become the calling cards of the midlife crisis but, if it is more than a myth, then humans may not be the only animals to experience it.
Now an international team of scientists claims to have found evidence for a slump in well-being among middle-aged chimpanzees and orangutans.
The study, which was published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, has raised eyebrows among some scientists but, according to the authors, the findings suggest that the midlife crisis may have its roots in the biology humans share with our closest evolutionary cousins.
The team from the US, Japan, Germany and the UK asked zookeepers, carers and others who worked with male and female apes of various ages to complete questionnaires on the animals.
The forms included questions about each apes mood, the enjoyment they gained from socializing, and their success at achieving certain goals.
The final question asked how carers would feel about being the ape for a week.
The nadir in the animals well-being occurred, on average, at 28.3 and 27.2 years old for the chimpanzees, and 35.4 years old for the orangutans.
In all three groups we find evidence that well-being is lowest in chimpanzees and orangutans at an age that roughly corresponds to midlife in humans, Weiss said.
Robin Dunbar, Professor of Evolutionary Psychology at Oxford University, was dubious about the findings.
Its hard to see anything in an apes life that would have that sort of pattern, that they would think about.
If we want to find the answer as to whats going on with the midlife crisis, we should look at what is similar in middle-aged humans, chimps and orangutans, he said. 
The method, called Virtopsy, is now being used at selected forensic medical institutes in Europe, having been pioneered by a group of scientists at the University of Zurich.
Basically there will be no such thing as the perfect murder any more as a virtual autopsy allows you to find every piece of evidence, he said.
The technique allows the detection of injuries such as lesions and blows often undetectable during a traditional autopsy, as well as air pockets, heart attacks and even cancer.
The Virtopsy has the potential to replace the autopsy one day, Richard Dirndorfer, one of the pioneers of DNA analysis in criminology, and a founder developer of Virtopsy, told the German science magazine PM.
The initial aim is to use the new method to complement the traditional autopsy.
It will enable forensic scientists to plan their autopsies far more efficiently, Dominic Wichmann, an internal medicine specialist at Hamburgs University Hospital, told Spiegel.
Criminologists from around the world have been travelling to Switzerland over the past few years to see the development of the new method for themselves.
In order to analyze the colour of the blood, the consistencies (of body fluids) or smells, well need to keep on with the conventional cut, said Lars Oesterhelweg, Deputy Director of the Institute of Forensic Medicine at the Charit Hospital in Berlin, which is using a version of the Virtopsy.
The Senate Intelligence Committee has approved a bill that would provide for increased transparency of the National Security Agencys bulk collection of US phone records but allow the controversial practice to continue.
It passed the committee by an 11-4 vote, paving the way for a full Senate vote.
Additionally, the bill allows the NSA to continue surveillance begun on foreigners outside the US if they enter the country for a transitory period not to exceed 72 hours.
The bill is a direct challenge to one introduced by Senator Patrick Leahy that would end domestic phone-records collection.
The NSAs invasive surveillance of Americans private information does not respect our constitutional values and needs fundamental reform, not incidental changes.
The NSA call-records programme is legal and subject to extensive congressional and judicial oversight, and I believe it contributes to our national security, she said in a statement.
After the committees hearing had ended, Feinstein strongly endorsed the NSAs main domestic programme.
I think theres huge misunderstanding about this NSA database programme, and how vital it is to protecting this country, she told reporters.
The fundamental question is: should the government have some reason to suspect wrongdoing before sweeping up Americans most personal information to feed into its databases?
Leahy and Sensenbrenner say yes; Feinstein says no.
The statements that American intelligence officials have made about collecting on the intentions of foreign leadership, thats consistent with the understanding Ive had for years, as a member of the Intelligence Committee, he said.
Feinstein unexpectedly announced that she was totally opposed to the foreign leader spying of the sort the NSA conducts of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Feinstein has been a staunch supporter of the NSAs bulk collection of Americans phone records.
The National Security Agency (NSA) has obtained direct access to the systems of Google, Facebook, Apple and other US internet giants, according to a top-secret document.
The NSA access is part of a previously undisclosed program called PRISM, which allows officials to collect material including search history, the content of emails, file transfers and live chats, the document says.
Although the presentation claims the program is run with the assistance of the companies, all those who responded to a request for comment denied knowledge of any such program.
The NSA access was enabled by changes to US surveillance law, introduced under President Bush and renewed under Obama in December 2012.
The program facilitates extensive, in-depth surveillance on live communications and stored information.
The law allows for the targeting of any customers of participating firms who live outside the US, or those Americans whose communications include people outside the US.
The participation of the internet companies in PRISM will add to the debate about the scale of surveillance by the intelligence services.
Companies are legally obliged to comply with requests for users communications under US law, but the PRISM program allows the intelligence services direct access to the companies servers.
The NSA document notes the operations have the assistance of communications providers in the US.
The PRISM program allows the NSA, the worlds largest surveillance organization, to obtain targeted communications without having to request them from the service providers and without having to obtain individual court orders.
This law does not allow the targeting of any US citizen or of any person located within the United States.
The program is subject to oversight by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, the Executive Branch and Congress.
This program was recently reauthorized by Congress after extensive hearings and debate.
What made Nelson Mandela great was precisely what made him human.
The US president said: Through his fierce dignity and unbending will to sacrifice his own freedom for the freedom of others, Madiba transformed South Africa  and moved all of us.
FW de Klerk  the South African president who freed Mandela, shared the Nobel Peace Prize with him in 1993 and paved the way for him to become South Africas first post-apartheid head of state  said the news was deeply saddening for South Africa and the world.
People gathered in the streets of South Africa to celebrate Mandelas life  In Soweto, people gathered to sing and dance near the house where he once lived.
With South Africa facing possible civil war, Mandela sought reconciliation with the white minority to build a new democracy.
After the Sharpeville massacre, in which 69 black protesters were shot dead by police, he took the difficult decision to launch an armed struggle.
His 91st birthday was marked by the first annual Mandela Day in his honour.
This is very encouraging, said Maheshwar Dhakal, an ecologist with Nepals Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation.
The census is based on the examination of pictures from more than 500 cameras placed in five protected areas and three wildlife corridors.
Dhakal said that a parallel survey was conducted in India and the results from both countries will be published later in 2013.
It will take a few more months for India, which now has 1,300 big cats in several huge protected areas, to finalize the data, he added.
Nepal has pledged to double the population of tigers by the year 2022 from 121 in 2009 when the last systematic tiger count took place.
The skin and bones are handed to middlemen, who pass easily through the porous border to India, where the major dealers are based.
One major problem is complicity between senior officials and mafia networks involved in the trade.
But they say Nepal needs to do more to protect the habitat and animals on which tigers prey so the big cats have enough space to roam and food to eat.
As the number of tigers has increased over the years, so have incidents of conflict with villagers.
But it should also come up with plans to protect people from tigers, Krishna Bhurtel, a local village headman in Chitwan, told Nepali newspaper Nagarik.
Wildlife authorities captured a tiger in Chitwan after it killed two people, including a villager who was pulled from his bed in May.
Diwakar Chapagain, who heads a World Wildlife Fund Nepal unit that monitors wildlife trade, said tiger skins were in demand in Tibet, where well-heeled people use them as festival costumes.
In Nepal, kings used to stand on tiger skins in front of stuffed tigers for special occasions.
Tiger bones are in high demand for use in traditional Chinese medicines.
The trade in tiger parts is lucrative and fetches thousands of dollars in illegal markets, Chapagain said, highlighting the threat tigers face. 
On the market square in Rjukan stands a statue of the towns founder, a noted Norwegian engineer and industrialist called Sam Eyde.

Two young mothers wheel their children into the square and stand in the sun.
Across the road, in the Nye Tider caf, sits the man responsible for this unexpected access to happiness.
The first inkling of an artwork Andersen called the Solspeil, or Sun mirror, came to him as the month of September began to fade: Every day, we would take our young child for a walk in the buggy, he says, and, every day, I realized we were having to go a little further down the valley to find the sun.
Throughout the seemingly endless intervening months, Andersen says, Wed look up and see blue sky above, and the sun high on the mountain slopes, but the only way we could get to it was to go out of town.
Twelve years after he first dreamed of his Solspeil, a German company specializing in so-called CSP  concentrated solar power  helicoptered in the three 17-sq-m glass mirrors that now stand high above the market square in Rjukan.
Like many others, he felt the money could have been better spent elsewhere  on a couple of extra carers to look after Rjukans old people, perhaps, or improved school facilities, cycle paths, a bit of rural road resurfacing.
In his office overlooking the square, Rjukans energetic young mayor, Steinar Bergsland, is interested not so much in the cost but in the benefits the mirrors might bring to the town.
A hi-tech company is interested in relocating to Rjukan, attracted by the cutting-edge technology on view at the top of the mountain and the publicity it has attracted.
And just look out of the window.
Now its actually here, people love it. 
Barack Obama flew back to Washington and his desk in the Oval Office on Wednesday, hours after delivering an election victory speech in Chicago in which he called for the country to unite behind him.
Unlike after his election in 2008, the President is unlikely to be given a honeymoon period.
While Obama easily beat off the challenge from his Republican opponent Mitt Romney, holding swing state after swing state, the election provided yet another reminder of just how divided America remains.
While the inauguration is not until January, in effect Obama embarked on his second term on Wednesday.
Having disappointed many supporters in his first term, he is looking now to establish a legacy that will transform him from a middling president into a great one.
He cited the need for both parties to find common ground and take steps together to help our economy grow and create jobs, which is critical to solving our debt.
Reid, so often at odds with Boehner, also sounded conciliatory, saying: I look at the challenges that we have ahead of us and I reach out to my Republican colleagues in the Senate and the House.
The trouble will come when talks move to detail, with the Republicans wanting to protect military spending while the Democrats seek cuts.
Obama has called for tax increases on households earning more than $250,000; Boehner has rejected any tax increases.
But having won, he returned to famous lines from earlier speeches, reprising once again his 2008 slogan about hope.
Stepping up to the lectern to the upbeat sounds of Stevie Wonders Signed, Sealed, Delivered, Im Yours, Obama told the ecstatic crowd of supporters: Tonight in this election, you, the American people, reminded us that while our road has been hard, while our journey has been long, we have picked ourselves up, we have fought our way back.
In a speech that lasted more than 25 minutes, after paying emotional tribute to his wife, Michelle, and his daughters, Malia and Sasha  as well as to his Vice-President, Joe Biden  Obama returned to the message that first brought him to national attention.
He continued: This is a time for great challenges for America and I pray the President will be successful in guiding our nation.
Historically, it would have been a disappointment for African Americans and many white liberals if the first black presidency had ended in failure, halted prematurely. 
Sweden is the best country for older people, Afghanistan the worst  but general affluence does not necessarily mean better conditions for the over-60s, according to the first global index on ageing.
While Swedens top ranking  followed by Norway, Germany, the Netherlands and Canada  may be predictable, the Global AgeWatch index throws up some surprising results.
This survey shows that history counts, said Mark Gorman, director of the HelpAge International advocacy group.
The top-ranked countries are what you would expect, but Scandinavian countries were not wealthy when they introduced universal pensions.
Everybody faces scarce resources, but they should not forget that, when they make investment decisions, they should also address issues of old age.
The index, developed with the UN Fund for Population and Development, spans 91 countries and 89% of the worlds older people.
Population ageing  when older people account for an increasingly large proportion of people  is happening fastest in developing countries.
There are gender differences among ageing populations, with women generally outliving men.
Lack of paid work (hence savings), less decision-making power in the family and vulnerability to violence contribute towards the disadvantage many women face in old age.
However, if appropriate measures are implemented, population ageing does not inevitably lead to significantly higher health care spending, according to the report, which highlights the importance of long-term investments in education and health care for older people.
Bolivia, ranked 46, despite being one of the poorest countries, has introduced progressive policies for older people, with a national plan on ageing, free health care and a non-contributory universal pension.
Good basic health care introduced decades ago in Chile and Costa Rica has served the ageing populations of those countries.
A good education system  basic literacy is crucial for older people as they deal with the pensions bureaucracy  is of great benefit later in life.
The same is true for Armenia, which, like other countries of the former Soviet Union, benefited from a robust education system.
The ageing index is calculated using 13 indicators under four headings: income security, health care, employment and education, and an enabling environment.
These categories were given increased weighting because of better data quality and countries were included only if there was sufficient data.
Professor Sir Richard Jolly, creator of the human development index, said: This groundbreaking index broadens the way we understand the needs and opportunities of older people through its pioneering application of human development methodology.
The aim of the bill has always been to respect the wishes of the deceased; however, relatives or friends may object to consent being deemed based on what they know about the views of the deceased.
When family members know that organ donation is what the deceased would have wanted, they usually agree to participate in the donation process.
The new law will work by clarifying peoples wishes around the issue of organ donation and, in turn, increase the rate of consent to donation.
The issue is controversial, with opponents worried that the pressing need for more kidneys and hearts will lead to the wishes of those who have died and their family being overruled.
We have the enduring problem of not having enough organs for people who need them, said Drakeford.
The British Medical Association has long campaigned for an opt-out system because of its concern over the growing number of people needing transplants  a result of medical progress in transplantation.
Members of the Muslim Council of Wales and the South Wales Jewish Representative Council have expressed reservations, while the Archbishop of Wales, Barry Morgan, said that donation ought to be a gift of love, of generosity.
Among those present was a Mexican prelate, Monsignor Oscar Sanchz Barba, from Guadalajara.
We were all in the Sala del Concistoro in the third loggia of the Apostolic Palace, he said.
We were all left   Sanchz Barba looked around him in the Bernini colonnade that embraces St Peters Square, grasping for the word, as speechless as the princes of the church who had just heard the man they believe to be Gods representative on earth give up on the job.
Before going on to assure the Pope of the cardinals loyalty and devotion, he said he and the others present had listened to you with a sense of bewilderment, almost completely incredulous.
John Thavis, who spent 30 years reporting on the Holy See and whose book, The Vatican Diaries, is soon to be published, said he had had an intuition the Pope might be about to resign and timed his return to Rome from the US accordingly.
Thavis noted that in the book-length interview Benedict gave to a German journalist, published as Light of the World in 2010, he had made it clear he considered it would be right to go if he felt he were no longer up to the job.
He has completed his series of books and most of his projects are off the ground.
Other theories will no doubt swirl around the Vatican in the days and weeks ahead, just as they did following the death of Pope John Paul I in 1978, 33 days after his election.
Already there is speculation that something was about to come out about Benedicts past.
Emerging from St Peters Basilica, Julia Rochester, from London, who described herself as a lapsed Catholic, was still turning over the implications of the Popes resignation.
It is a question many practising Catholics will be asking of their priests in the weeks ahead.
He also revealed his disdain for and distrust of some sections of the media and described how his father constantly reminded him to behave more like a member of the royal family.
A commander of the armys most sophisticated attack helicopter, the prince said he had fired on the Taliban during operations to support ground troops and rescue injured Afghan and NATO personnel.
One in the army, one socially in my own private time and then one with the family and stuff like that.
He admitted he sometimes let himself down with his laddish behaviour, which he put down to probably being too much army and not enough prince, but he said he was entitled to privacy, too.
He said he was particularly annoyed by articles comparing his role as an Apache co-pilot gunner to Spitfire crews waiting to scramble during the second world war.
The prince said his suspicion of the media was rooted in the treatment of his family when I was very small, but that he couldnt help monitoring the stories written about him.
But all it does is just upset me and anger me that people can get away with writing the stuff they do; not just about me, but about everything and everybody.
Four years ago, the prince had to be spirited out of Afghanistan during his first tour after a media embargo was broken by mistake by an Australian magazine.
Two-man crews from the BBC, Sky and ITN were sent once each to report on his visit, while a photographer and a reporter from the Press Association were embedded on all three visits.
Asked where he and his brothers fascination with helicopters came from, he said, Probably the fact that you can only fit a certain amount of people in a helicopter, therefore no one can follow us, like you guys. 
These experiments showed that we have established a sophisticated, direct communication linkage between brains, Nicolelis said in a statement.
The scientists first demonstrated that rats can share, and act on, each others sensory information by electrically connecting their brains via tiny grids of electrodes that reach into the motor cortex, the brain region that processes movement.
The rats were trained to press a lever when a light went on above it.
When they performed the task correctly, they got a drink of water.
Only one compartment had a light that came on above the lever.
In trials, the second rat responded correctly to the imported brain signals 70% of the time by pressing the lever.
If the receiving rat failed at the task, the first rat was not rewarded with a drink, and appeared to change its behaviour to make the task easier for its partner.
In further experiments,  In the final test, the scientists connected rats on different continents and beamed their brain activity back and forth over the internet.
Nicolelis said the team is now working on ways to link several animals brains at once to solve more complex tasks.
In theory, you could imagine that a combination of brains could provide solutions that individual brains cannot achieve by themselves.
Anders Sandberg, who studies the ethics of neurotechnologies at the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford University, said the work was very important in helping to understand how brains encode information.
Often, we dont want to reveal those drafts; that would be embarrassing and confusing.
Richard died at Bosworth on 22 August 1485, the last English king to fall in battle, and the researchers revealed how for the first time.
But many of the other injuries were after death, suggesting a gruesome ritual on the battlefield and as the kings body was brought back to Leicester, as he was stripped, mocked and mutilated.
One terrible injury, a stab through the right buttock and into his pelvis, was certainly after death and could not have happened when his lower body was protected by armour.
Bob Savage, a medieval arms expert from the Royal Armouries who helped identify the wounds, said it was probably not a war weapon but the sort of sharp knife or dagger any workman might have carried.
Michael Ibsen, the Canadian-born furniture maker proved to be the descendant of Richards sister, heard the confirmation on Sunday and listened to the unfolding evidence in shocked silence.
Although it is by no means certain that the bones found at the tower centuries later are theirs, there may be more DNA detective work to be done there. 
The baby is the first Prince of Cambridge to be born for more than 190 years since Prince George of Cambridge, a grandson of George III and the only son of Prince Adolphus Frederick, the 1st Duke of Cambridge.
Following tradition, a formal notice was posted on an ornate rococo-style easel  the same used to announce Prince Williams birth in 1982  in the forecourt of Buckingham Palace shortly before 9pm.
Within an hour, the numbers had swelled from hundreds to thousands outside the palace, with locals and tourists alike keen to share in the historic moment.
It is an important moment in the life of our nation but, I suppose, above all, it is a wonderful moment for a warm and loving couple who have got a brand new baby boy.
May God bless them all with love, health and happiness.
Standing at the edge of space above the deserts of New Mexico, Felix Baumgartner paused slightly.
But they decided to go ahead, watched by a record 8 million people as the jump was streamed live on YouTube.
The two-and-a-half-hour journey upwards, during which the curvature of the Earth became visible and the skies gradually turned black, was matched with a rather more rapid descent.
Three cameras attached to Baumgartners suit recorded his free-fall of just over four minutes  which failed to break the existing free-fall record for duration  and then the parachute opening.
He had already done two practice free-falls in preparation for this attempt  one from 71,000 feet in March and a second from 97,000 feet in July 2012.
He was chasing five different records: the first human to ever break the sound barrier in free-fall; the highest free-fall altitude jump; the highest manned balloon flight; the longest free-fall; and his jump platform is believed to be the largest manned balloon in history.
The stunt, which was seven years in the planning and sponsored by Red Bull drinks, beat two of Kittingers records: the retired US air force colonel previously held the high altitude and speed records for parachuting.
To laughter, he added: The most beautiful moment was when I was standing on the landing area and Mike Todd [the life support engineer who dressed Baumgartner in his suit] showed up and he had a smile on his face like a little kid.
Baumgartner said that he had come to feel like Todds son, adding: He was so happy that I was alive.
Earlier, Todd had told the press conference: The world needs a hero right now, and they got one in Felix Baumgartner.
He has promised to settle down and enjoy his post-jump years with his girlfriend, Nicole Oetl, flying helicopters on rescue missions in the US and Austria. 
Currently the beach has little more than an access road lined with camper vans from Germany, France, Italy and Britain, filled with windsurfers and kitesurfers lured by the areas strong winds.
Environmental and conservation groups have protested that the project will harm the habitats of protected species, but for most councillors here the issue is simple: jobs.
The Socialist opposition in Madrid attacked the proposal, and Galindo said it discriminated against migrant workers who flocked to Spain during the boom years, many of them from Morocco, whose coastline is just 14km away and can be seen from Tarifa.
Surfers fear that new buildings in Valdevaqueros would reduce the strength of the famous local Levant wind but fail to lure traditional package holidaymakers.
Campaigners say it also has a vital role in the animal world as a crossroads for migrating species.
Money is once again being put before urban laws and European environmental directives, said Ral Romeva, a member of the European Parliament who is Vice-President of the Greens group.
Many locals are also wondering why a resort should be built 10km away, rather than on wasteland near Tarifas picturesque old centre, with its typically Andalusian whitewashed walls and winding streets, dominated by a 10th-century Moorish castle.
My opinion and that of catering workers is that we agree with the complex as long as it creates jobs in the town, which is what is needed, but we are against it being for the benefit of a few, said Cristbal Lobato, who has worked at the same beachside bar in Tarifa for 30 years.
What they want to do is turn this into Benidorm, but what draws people here is wildlife and the wind.
The direct action group UK Uncut plans to turn dozens of the coffee empires UK branches into crches, refuges and homeless shelters to highlight the chains tax avoidance tactics.
In his appearance before the committee, Starbucks Chief Financial Officer, Troy Alstead, will attempt to repair the companys reputation, which continues to suffer because of the controversy.
MPs accused HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) officials of having cosy relationships with big businesses.
The campaign group UK Uncut is attempting to draw a link between government cuts, in particular those that affect women, and tax avoidance by multinational businesses.
Sarah Greene, a UK Uncut activist, said funding for refuges and rape crisis centres faced cuts unless companies paid their fair share of tax.
Longstanding Uncut campaigner Anna Walker said Weve chosen to really highlight the impact of the cuts on women.
So there is going to be a real focus on transforming Starbucks into those services that are being cut by the government  [such as] refuges and crches.
The coffee store chain insists it pays the correct level of taxes.
The group Chief Executive, Howard Schultz, has said in a statement: Starbucks has always paid taxes in the UK despite recent suggestions to the contrary.
Over the last three years alone, our company has paid more than 160m in various taxes, including National Insurance contributions, VAT and business rates.
Margaret Hodge, who chairs the Public Accounts Committee, told parliament last month that Apple, eBay, Facebook, Google and Starbucks had avoided nearly 900m of tax.
We do need to make sure we are encouraging these businesses to invest in our country as they are, but they should be paying fair taxes as well.
A spokeswoman for Starbucks said: While the subject of tax law can be extremely complex, Starbucks respects and complies with tax laws and accounting rules in each of the 61 countries where we do business, including the UK  a market that we remain committed to for the long term.
When you take into account the indirect employment created by Starbucks investments in the UK, the companys extended economic impact to the UK economy exceeds 80m annually.
Each year, the global number of deaths to which bacterial resistance contributes far outstrips those caused by terrorist attacks.
At the beginning of the twentieth century, life expectancy in the UK stood at around 47 years of age for a man and 50 for a woman, a number heavily affected by the very high rate of infant mortality in those days.
In contrast, a child born in Britain today has a better than one in four chance of reaching their 100th birthday.
In our hospitals and our GP surgeries we have abused the drugs that gave us such a huge advantage over infectious disease, using them too often and too indiscriminately.
We assumed that antibiotic therapy was an advantage we could enjoy forever.
New, more resistant species have been identified.
Vancomycin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (VRSA) emerged in our hospitals.
Antibiotics have become drugs that are expensive to develop, that are only used in short courses and that quickly become ineffective due to the evolution of bacterial resistance.
Since the first MRSA deaths in otherwise healthy children in the US in 1998, the number of deaths from MRSA infection in the US each year has risen to tens of thousands  outstripping the number of deaths caused by AIDS.
Bacterial resistance in hospitals is everywhere you look.
And somehow, the pharmaceutical companies have to be convinced to chase the development of these less profitable drugs.
The head of Swedens prison and probation service, Nils Oberg, announced in November 2013 that four Swedish prisons are to be closed due to an out of the ordinary decline in prisoner numbers.
Although there has been no fall in crime rates, between 2011 and 2012 there was a 6% drop in Swedens prisoner population, now a little over 4,500.
But, after a number of high-profile escapes in 2004, we had to rebalance and place more emphasis on security.
Sweden was the first country in Europe to introduce the electronic tagging of convicted criminals and continues to strive to minimize short-term prison sentences wherever possible by using community-based measures, which have been proven to be more effective at reducing reoffending.
The overall reoffending rate in Sweden stands at between 30 and 40% over three years  to compare that with another European country, the number is around half that of the UK.
In the UK, for example, children aged ten to 17 and young people under the age of 21 record the highest reoffending rates: almost three quarters and two thirds, respectively.
One strong reason for the drop in prison numbers might be the amount of post-prison support available in Sweden.
The service is assisted by around 4,500 lay supervisors  members of the public who volunteer to befriend and support offenders under supervision.
He was helped by a newly formed organization run by former prisoners called Kris (Criminals Return Into Society).
Both organizations work with the same goal: helping prisoners successfully reintegrate into society after they have been released.
With X-Cons, we meet them at the gate and support them into accommodation and offer a network of support.
There are some people who will not or cannot change.
But, in my experience, the majority of prisoners want to change, and we must do what we can to help to facilitate that.
Actually you do get used to it after a while, said George, an IT technician from a village on the coast.
That usually becomes clear later from video clips posted by opposition media outlets on YouTube.
In the centre of town, a shopkeeper complained sadly that his baby daughter cries at the sound of shelling.
Zeina, a twenty-something student, fears becoming desensitized to suffering  and perhaps to danger too.
In February, 80 people, including schoolchildren, reportedly died near the ruling Baath Party headquarters in Mazraa.
The crater is still visible, marked by an enormous patch of fresh asphalt on the main road going north.
Security measures have intensified since the devastating bombing of the national security crisis cell in July 2012, when four of Assads most senior aides were killed.
Concrete blast barriers  often painted in the Syrian flags black, red and white  now protect official premises, not just the military or defence installations that are obvious targets.
Checkpoints on main roads funnel traffic for ID checks and baggage searches with handheld explosive detectors  vital to stop future bombers.
One view is that the fight for Syrias capital is coming, but not quite yet  in the summer perhaps, some predict, when the rebels have consolidated their gains in the south.
But few here seem to expect things to get any better. 
At Addis Ababa airport, visitors are greeted by pictures of golden grains, minute ochre-red seeds and a group of men gathered around a giant pancake.
Ethiopia is one of the worlds poorest countries, well known for its precarious food security situation.
But it is also the native home of teff, a highly nutritious ancient grain increasingly finding its way into health-food shops and supermarkets in Europe and America.
Teffs tiny seeds  the size of poppy seeds  are high in calcium, iron and protein, and boast an impressive set of amino acids.
Naturally gluten free, the grain can substitute for wheat flour in anything from bread and pasta to waffles and pizza bases.
Across the country, and in neighbouring Eritrea, diners gather around large pieces of injera, which doubles as cutlery, scooping up stews and feeding one another as a sign of loyalty or friendship  a tradition known as gursha.
But a growing appetite for traditional crops and booming health-food and gluten-free markets are breathing new life into the grain, increasingly touted as Ethiopias second gift to the world, after coffee.
Sophie Kebede, a London-based entrepreneur who owns a UK company specializing in the grain, says she was flabbergasted when she discovered its nutritional value.
In Bolivia and Peru, reports of rising incomes owing to the now-global quinoa trade have come alongside those of malnutrition and conflicts over land, as farmers sell their entire crop to meet western demand.
Its strategy, published in 2013, argues that the grain could play an important role in school meals and emergency aid programmes, and help reduce malnutrition  particularly among children and adolescents.
The governments Agricultural Transformation Agency aims to boost yields by developing improved varieties of the grain, along with new planting techniques and tools to reduce post-harvest losses.
Mama Fresh is a family firm that has been selling injera to top restaurants and hotels in the Ethiopian capital for years.
It aims to double exports to America in 2014 and will soon start producing teff-based pizzas, bread and cookies.
Regassa Feyissa, an Ethiopian agricultural scientist and former head of the National Institute for Biodiversity, warns that, without careful planning, increased teff production for export may displace other important crops for farmers.
With little Ethiopian teff on the international market, farmers in the US have started planting the crop.
The British government announced that she would receive a ceremonial funeral with military honours at St Pauls Cathedral.
He added: As our first woman prime minister, Margaret Thatcher succeeded against all the odds, and the real thing about Margaret Thatcher is that she didnt just lead our country, she saved our country, and I believe she will go down as the greatest British peacetime prime minister.
In a statement, President Barack Obama said, Here in America, many of us will never forget her standing shoulder to shoulder with President Reagan, reminding the world that we are not simply carried along by the currents of history  we can shape them with moral conviction, unyielding courage and iron will.
Thatcher, who was 87, had been in declining health for some years, suffering from dementia.
The Labour Party disagreed with much of what she did and she will always remain a controversial figure.
The deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, said: Margaret Thatcher was one of the defining figures in modern British politics.
Describing her as a political phenomenon, the former Tory prime minister Sir John Major said: Her outstanding characteristics will always be remembered by those who worked closely with her: courage and determination in politics, and humanity and generosity of spirit in private.
The Iron Lady proved a significant cold war ally of the US president Ronald Reagan in the final showdown with the Soviet Union, which broke up under reformist pressures led by Mikhail Gorbachev, a Kremlin leader with whom Thatcher famously declared she could do business.
Thatcher was an unremarkable mid-ranking Conservative until she unexpectedly became party leader in 1975.
In retirement, she wrote highly successful memoirs in two volumes and campaigned energetically on behalf of the Thatcher Foundation, which sought to promote her values around the world. 
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has appealed to Washington to sort out its finances after the US pulled back from the brink of a debt default and hundreds of thousands of federal employees returned to work after a 16-day government shutdown.
As the US President, Barack Obama, warned Weve got to get out of the habit of governing by crisis, the IMFs managing director, Christine Lagarde, appealed for more stability.
Stock markets in Japan, China, Hong Kong and South Korea initially reflected relief after the Republicans finally capitulated in their failed attempt to undermine Obamas healthcare reforms.
Chinas official Xinhua News Agency had accused Washington of jeopardizing other countries dollar assets.
It offers a temporary fix, funding the government until 15 January and raising the debt ceiling until 7 February.
But the president made clear he did not expect another bitter budget fight and shutdown in 2014.
In brief remarks at the White House shortly before the House vote, Obama said he hoped the deal would lift the cloud of uncertainty that had hung over the country in recent weeks.
However, the political deal was one of the worst of all possible outcomes for Republicans.
None of their stated goals was achieved and polls showed that voters overwhelmingly blamed them for the crisis. 
More than a third of all women worldwide  35.6%  will experience physical or sexual violence in their lifetime, usually from a male partner, according to the first comprehensive study of its kind from the World Health Organization (WHO).
It also finds that a large proportion of murders of women  38%  are carried out by intimate partners.
Yet, wealthier nations are not necessarily always safer for women  a third of women in high-income countries (32.7%) will experience violence at some stage in their lives.
Of the women who suffer violence, 42% sustain injuries, which can bring them to the attention of healthcare staff.
That, says the report, is often the first opportunity for violence in the home to be detected and for the woman to be offered help.
Violence has a profound effect on womens health.
For the first time, we have compared data from all over the world on the magnitude of partner violence and sexual violence by non-partners and the impact of these sorts of violence on health, said Garcia-Moreno.
These included HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, depression, women turning to alcohol, unwanted pregnancies and low-birthweight babies.
The authors say that their previous research shows that better-educated women are less likely to suffer violence, as are those who have jobs, although not in all regions.
There is a need to tackle social norms, said Watts.
Over the past decade, there has been increasing recognition of the problem, she said, but one has to recognize that it is a complex problem.
The new WHO clinical and policy guidelines recommend training for healthcare staff in recognizing the signs of domestic violence and sexual assault, but they rule out general screening  there is not a case for asking every woman who arrives in a clinic whether she has been subjected to violence.
But, if you see a woman coming back several times with undisclosed injuries, you should be asking about domestic violence, said Garcia-Moreno.
Years later, I was sometimes in a situation where I could tell there was something else going on in the woman I was interviewing, but didnt have any sense that domestic violence was the issue.
Now, I think I would handle the interview very differently. 
But, on Tuesday 8th April, 2014, she described the extraordinary moment when she received a message in a bottle, 101 years after he had lobbed it into the Baltic Sea.
Thought to be the worlds oldest message in a bottle, it was presented to Erdmann by the museum that is now exhibiting it in Germany.
It was very surprising, Erdmann, 62, said, recalling how she found out about the bottle.
Her visitor was a genealogical researcher who had managed to track her down in Berlin after the letter was given to the International Maritime Museum in the northern port city of Hamburg.
The brown beer bottle, which had been in the water for 101 years, was found in the catch of Konrad Fischer, a fisherman, who had been out in the Baltic Sea off the northern city of Kiel.
Holger von Neuhoff, curator for ocean and science at the museum, said this bottled message was the oldest he had come across.
Researchers believe Erdmanns grandfather, Richard Platz, threw the bottle in the sea while on a hike with a nature appreciation group in 1913.
Like her grandfather, Erdmann said, she also liked culture and travelling around the world.
Sleep deprivation used to be a badge of honour: a sign you were busy and important and very much in demand.
Snoozing was losing and sleep was for wimps.
For the more upmarket snoozer, luxury hotels are offering sleep retreats; more than $1,000 gets you dinner and a movie about sleep.
And, if youre staying home, you can upgrade your bedroom with everything from a mattress cover with a sensor that tracks your sleep ($249) to a brainwave-monitoring sleeping mask that lets you nap more efficiently ($299).
A number of companies already have nap pods and Huffington predicts that nap rooms in offices are going to become as common as conference rooms in the next two years.
How did sleep, something humans have done since long before Huffington awoke to it, suddenly become so fashionable?
Our bodies have become input/output devices that we monitor and optimize for greater efficiency and sleep has become another data set to be tracked.
Huffington calls them her A-Team; they do everything from running her errands to planning her travel to loading The Huffington Post on her computer in the morning.
Numerous studies show that youre more likely to sleep poorly if youre poor.
Want to know who gets the most sleep and the best quality of sleep in America?
The very real sleep crisis we face isnt down to a few rich people thinking its a waste of time; its down to the 99% not being able to afford to spend time sleeping.
The real prize is finding a way to negate sleep deprivation so humans can function on less sleep.
In 2008, the Pentagon published a report called Human Performance which examined the possibility of a future in which soldiers could perform at their peak with only a couple of hours sleep.
This would lead to an approximately twofold decrease in the casualty rate.
The Silicon Valley firm, already the worlds biggest company  with a stock market valuation of $591bn  has seen its brand value increase by 21% in 12 months, according to the closely followed Interbrand Best Global Brands annual report.
Apple, which is recognized the world over by its simple Apple with a bite missing emblem, led a surge of technology companies in the 2014 report, which has pushed more traditionally valuable brands  such as Coca-Cola, McDonalds and Gillette  down the table.
Jez Frampton, chief executive of Interbrand, which is part of global advertising group Omnicom, said: Benefitting immensely from the rise of digital and, later, mobile technology, savvy brands like Apple grew stronger.
A Chinese company has made it into the top 100 for the first time, with mobile-phone and broadband firm Huawei entering the rankings in 94th place with a brand value of $4.3bn.
Most of the brands in the top 100 are US-owned, the highest-placed non-US brands being South Koreas Samsung (6th), Japans Toyota (8th) and Germanys Mercedes-Benz (10th).
Customers expect seamless interactions, responsiveness, 24/7 accessibility, customization options and high levels of personalization, he said.
But, for the small but growing Muslim community of Iqaluit, Nunavut, life in the land of the midnight sun poses a real challenge during the month of Ramadan, during which Muslims typically fast from sunrise to sunset.
I havent fainted once, said 29-year-old Abdul Karim, one of the few in the city who has carefully timed his Ramadan fast to the Arctic sun since moving from Ottawa in 2011.
Most in Iqaluit adhere to the timetable followed by Muslims in Ottawa, some 1,300 miles south of the city  following the advice of Muslim scholars who have said Muslims in the far north should observe Ramadan using the timetable of Mecca or the nearest Muslim city.
It still means fasting for some 18 hours a day, said Atif Jilani, who moved to Iqaluit from Toronto in 2015.
In recent years, much of the community has opted to follow the Ramadan timetable of Edmonton, in Alberta.
Some, such as Awan  a father of two young children, including a 12-yearold who recently started fasting  follow the timings of Mecca.
If I fast Yellowknife or Edmonton times, my son might say, Papa, you are really insane.
Faced with the impossibility of following the local movements of the sun, the 100 or so Muslims in Inuvik, a small town that sits 125 miles north of the Arctic Circle, have also been following Edmontons timetable.
The adherence to Edmontons schedule was already in place in 2001 when he moved from Toronto to the small northern community of 3,500 people.
At times, it can be psychologically challenging to follow the clock rather than what is happening outside, Alkhalaf said.
In Inuvik, where much of the population is Inuit, the Muslim community has sought to strike a balance between Ramadan and the local culture and traditions.
In Iqaluit, as the Muslim community prepares to mark the end of Ramadan, some reflect that 2016s timing  stretching across some of the longest days of the year  has made it one of the more challenging of recent years.
Its particularly true for those like Karim who have determinedly followed the local sunrise and sunset.
But, his efforts will be rewarded years from now, said Karim, thanks to the lunar calendar.
When a course is open entry  MOOCs have no enrolment criteria and no fees to pay  then participants are going to behave very differently from students in a traditional higher education setting.
Mining the data captured about how, why and when millions of participants opt to sign up, interact with their material, submit their assignments, message each other and drop out of the course may be one way of getting a return on the investment.
Students in developing countries hungry for access to first-world universities?
People lacking qualifications who want to use MOOCs as a bridge to higher education?
Or hobby learners, who are keen to learn about a subject area in which they have an interest?
Learning online is a different thing, needs quite advanced learning skills, confirms David Kernohan, progamme manager for eLearning Innovation at Jisc, a charity that champions the use of digital technologies in UK education and research.
With MOOCs, theres very little support available: the student is dropped in and tends not to get any individual attention.
This is, instead, approximated by peer support such as online discussion forums.
While this may mean that online study is unattractive or difficult for someone without high-level qualifications, it does, he says, suggest that MOOCs could be a really good tool for continuing education.
Mike Sharples, chair of Educational Technology, doesnt buy into that cynicism.
He believes that recruiting international students onto university courses is only a secondary objective of running MOOCs  though they could certainly be a very canny marketing move, as he observes that if 20,000 people sign up to a MOOC  well, you only need 20 of those to enrol afterwards to run a masters.
The real challenge is to allow those countries not just to consume and study MOOCs, but also to create them. 
An international agreement to improve safety in Bangladeshs clothing factories is facing the threat of legal action as factory owners demand compensation for the cost of closures and repair work.
With some repair programmes expected to take months, factory owners say they cannot shoulder the costs of paying staff while factories are closed, alongside the expense of some major works needed to ensure buildings are safe.
The building overhauls are being carried out in the wake of the collapse of the Rana Plaza complex in the capital of Bangladesh, Dhaka, in 2013, in which 1,138 people were killed.
The factory owner said that the Accord agreement had pussyfooted around the issue of who paid for factory closures amid efforts to get as many brands as possible to sign up to a deal in the wake of the Rana Plaza disaster.
He said there was no clear process in place to handle the costs involved.
While 12 factories have been identified so far by the Accord as needing significant work, Holdcroft said many of those only needed partial closure in order to reduce stress on the building so production could continue on other floors.
The Accord also legally binds brands to ensure that workers are paid during factory closures.
She said the detail on who would make payments had been left open in order to ensure that all those factory owners who could afford to pay for repairs and compensation for workers made the necessary contribution.
However, pressure on the Accord to contribute to the payment of displaced workers has ratcheted up after a rival factory-safety group backed by US retailers including Walmart and Gap, the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety, set aside $5m to help pay factory workers for up to two months while work is carried out on the buildings it has identified as needing improvement.
Its corrugated iron walls are hung with educational charts  illustrated letters of the alphabet and a map of Bangladesh.
But, the constant sound of hammering and the chemicals in the air that catch in the back of the throat and irritate the eyes make it hard to concentrate.
Once they are in primary school, the children can do homework at the centres, with help from their peers.
The urban development centres aim to create an education-friendly environment in the communities and change their cultural mindset towards the children, says SOHAYs programme manager, Mohammed Abdullah al-Mamun.
SOHAY also runs sessions for parents and employers to discourage child labour and offers skills training to increase family income.
Getting working children into formal education is really very challenging, says Mamun.
But, after being introduced to education at one of SOHAYs centres, she now goes to a state primary school.
Her father works in a rickshaw garage and her mother is a domestic worker, but they were keen for their daughter to go to school.
In 2015, SOHAY helped 1,540 children to leave hazardous work and 2,125 vulnerable children  those in danger of entering work  into school.
The Labour Law of Bangladesh 2006 bans children under the age of 14 from working but, according to the UN childrens agency, UNICEF, 4.7 million children under that age are employed in the informal sector and 1.3 million aged five to 17 work in hazardous industries.
The organization talked to community members about why it was important to get children into school.
They selected community volunteers who were motivated to change childrens lives and formed groups with social workers, community leaders, mothers, young volunteers and the local government.
Children are just passing their time without education and waiting to become involved in hazardous work.
On the final day of his last visit to Britain as US president, Obama told 500 youth leaders at a town hall meeting in London: Im here to ask you to reject the notion there are forces we cant control.
When asked about his presidential legacy, Obama said he was proud of the healthcare reforms, which received huge cheers from the audience, and said of the US response to the 2008 financial crisis: Saving the world from great depression  that was quite good.
Questioned on the controversial Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), he said: The answer to globalization is not to pull up the drawbridge and shut off, though it was crucial to pay attention to workers rights.
Before Obama arrived, Tanya Williams, a community engagement officer, told the Guardian: I love Michelle but I like Obama and its exciting to have the chance to hear someone who has changed so much and galvanized so many people who didnt vote before.
Obama ended the session by taking a question from a young Sikh Londoner, who asked about the issue of racial profiling at airports and being mistaken for a Muslim.
I visited a mosque a few months ago and said our greatest allies are American Muslims who are most integrated and economically well off, he said.
Furqan Naeem, a campaigner from Manchester, said: I recently visited the States through the US embassy on the community leaders programme and saw first hand some really important work the president did in celebrating Americas diversity and bringing communities together.
Kenny Imafidon, the managing director of the youth organization ClearView Research, said afterwards: It was a great opportunity and what will stick with me is what he said about meeting with people who have different politics from you and having to make compromises.
Asked if they talked about the presidents intervention in the debate on Britains membership of the EU, Corbyn said it was discussed briefly.
Obama ended the day at a dinner with the prime minister and the US ambassador, Matthew Barzun, at the ambassadors residence, before travelling on to Germany. 
Armed with anonymous metadata on peoples calls and texts, but not the content of the communications, two scientists at Stanford University worked out individuals names, where they lived and the names of their partners.
Other data pointed to a new pregnancy and a person with multiple sclerosis.
The results highlight the extraordinary power of telephone metadata  the number called, when and for how long  particularly when it is paired with public information available from services such as Google, Yelp and Facebook.
As Stewart Baker, the former general counsel at the US National Security Agency (NSA), put it in the aftermath of Edward Snowdens revelations: Metadata absolutely tells you everything about somebodys life.
Now, we have hard evidence we can point to that didnt exist in the past, he said.
For the study, the researchers signed up 823 people who agreed to have metadata collected from their phones through an Android app.
Using a simple computer program to analyse peoples call patterns, they inferred who among the study volunteers was in a relationship.
Pigeon skeletons lie among shattered mirrors and water streams through broken cornicing.
It is one of ten mansions in the middle of The Bishops Avenue  the heart of Londons spiralling property market  that have stood almost entirely vacant since they were bought a quarter of a century ago, it is believed on behalf of members of the Saudi Arabian royal family.
Nature has taken over to the extent that owls have moved in.
It is a desolate scene repeated up and down the supposedly prestigious avenue that Lloyds Bank has calculated is the second most expensive street in Britain.
While more and more people struggle to get on to Londons property ladder as house prices rise at 11.2% a year, 16 mansions on the most expensive stretch of The Bishops Avenue are sitting empty, many behind padlocked gates, with their windows shuttered with steel grilles and overgrown grounds patrolled by guard dogs.
Across the street stands another derelict mansion, worth 18m, with smashed windows and walls coated in anti-climb paint.
The dereliction can be agonizing for people struggling to keep a roof above their heads in one of the worlds most expensive cities.
One security guard working on the avenue said it was exasperating to see so many tens of thousands of square feet of property  enough to house dozens of people  falling apart.
Now, Chinese house hunters are following Russians and Kazakhs who have spent millions securing an address estate agents tell them is as world famous as the Champs Elyses and Rodeo Drive.
Inside one, water drips through a huge crystal chandelier onto a thick carpet rotting under sections of collapsed ceiling.
Moss grows through shattered bricks and mirrored tiles are scattered across a bathroom.
The swimming pool is filled with a foot of brackish water and has flowers growing through its tiles.
Unopened wooden crates marked bullet-proof glass reveal the security fears of the previous owners.
Magdy Adib Ishak-Hannah, an Egyptian-born private healthcare mogul, whose personal wealth is 45m, said he was in the minority of permanent residents.
The multimillion-pound wrecks are evidence of a property culture in which the worlds richest people see British property as investments.
Nevertheless, the talk on the avenue is about building 5m apartments, instead of 50m mansions, in an effort to draw people back.
I just picked it up, Louise Haggerty, a 56-year-old hairdresser and waitress, said of her 1am trip to the Black Friday sales.
One of those lads was Andy Blackett, 30, an estate agent, who had two trolleys full of bargains.
Someone snatched my telly from me  its cos Im the smaller one.
Blackett, Fischer and some mates had driven to Sainsburys at 12.45am after retreating from the bedlam of Tescos 24-hour Lea Valley supermarket, where the Black Friday sale started at midnight.
Greater Manchester Police said at least two people had been arrested at Black Friday sales events already that morning.
South Wales Police also reported receiving a number of calls from staff at Tesco stores after they became concerned due to the volume of people who had turned up to sale events.
In her basket was a pint of semi-skimmed and a loaf of bread.
Its crazy, really, having it at midnight  the police must have more important things to do at night than be called to sales.
Experts fear that restaurants and caterers are seeing so many people claiming they have allergies (which can be dangerous for the individual), when in fact they have a food intolerance (which is not), that they may not take all the precautions they should when serving a person who has a genuine allergy.
There have been a number of fatalities where people have gone to a restaurant and alerted staff that they have an allergy to a particular food and the meal has been served up containing that allergen.
They include a home-testing kit that looks for specific IgG (immunoglobulin G) antibodies against food stuffs in the blood.
While these antibodies are part of the immune systems response to infections, the best medical evidence has shown elevated IgG levels do not suggest an allergy, the guide says.
Also debunked is a test, a mixture of acupuncture and homeopathy, which attempts to measure electronic resistance across the skin while the child or adult holds the suspect food in their hand.
Hair follicle testing is also pointless, the guide says.
Hair is not involved in allergic reactions so testing hair samples cannot provide any useful information on allergic status.
The conviction that a childs chronic lethargy or headaches or eczema are caused by an allergy takes a long time and many tests to prove or disprove.
It is tempting to go to an alternative therapist who will do a single test and provide a quick, but inaccurate, answer.
And those waiting outside were the lucky ones.
Instead, they decide to train their powerful telescopes on Jupiter and Venus and later to pick out stars such as Capella and Betelgeuse.
Fildes, 49, is at the forefront of the UKs burgeoning astrotourism industry.
The 2013 Star Count revealed that only 5% of the UK population can see more than 31 stars on a good night.
In Northumberland Dark Sky Park, as the area was rebadged, it is so dark that Venus casts a shadow on the Earth.
He is planning Britains first astrovillage, one that would house the largest public observatory in the world and boast a 100-seat auditorium, a 100-seat planetarium, a one-metre aperture telescope, and radiomagnetic and solar telescopes.
The multimillion-pound project would feature a hotel and draw in 100,000 people a year, four times the number currently able to use the observatory.
Since Exmoor was designated Europes first International Dark Sky Reserve  one notch below Dark Sky Park  in 2011, a range of local businesses offering stargazing breaks and safaris has sprung up.
The UK will have to go some way to eclipse northern Chile, which boasts more than a dozen tourist observatories and has some of the clearest skies in the world.
Ultimately, though, Fildes believes people are starting to appreciate what lies above.
Guillaume Chapron from Swedens University of Agricultural Sciences and researchers across Europe found wolves, in some cases, living in suburban areas alongside up to 3,050 people per square kilometre  higher than the population density of Cambridge or Newcastle.
The population density of the Scottish Highlands is nine people per sq km.
Im not saying its a peace-and-love story  coexistence often means conflict  but its important to manage that conflict, keep it at a low level and resolve the problems it causes.
The reasons for its success in Europe include political stability, burgeoning populations of prey species such as wild deer and financial support for non-lethal livestock protection such as electric fences, which mean that farmers do not resort to shooting wild predators.
Most crucial, said Chapron, has been the EU Habitats Directive, which has compelled member states to protect and revive rare species.
The revival was welcomed by author and commentator George Monbiot, who is launching Rewilding Britain, a new charity to encourage the return of wild landscape and extinct species.
It is great to see the upward trend continuing but Britain is completely anomalous  weve lost more of our large mammals than any country except for Ireland, he said.
Apart from the accidental reintroduction of boar, weve done almost nothing, whereas, in much of the rest of Europe, weve got bears, lynx and wolves coming back.
The survey found the Eurasian lynx living permanently in 11 population groups across 23 European countries, of which only five were native populations, indicating the success of reintroduction efforts.
If it works in the rest of Europe, theres absolutely no reason why it cant work in the UK, he said, pointing out that bears and wolves are found within an hour of Rome.
Theres no demographic reason why we cant have a similar return of wildlife in the UK. 
If we come every day, maybe we can touch our dreams, says Kamal, a refugee from Sudans war-torn Darfur district who comes to three or four hours of classes every day.
The 29-year-old electrical engineer is one of dozens, perhaps hundreds, of refugees living in the jungle camp outside Calais who have applied for asylum in France and are eager to learn the language of what they hope will be their new home.
France is already home to more than a quarter of a million refugees, according to United Nations data  the country has taken in more than twice as many as the UK, even though the countries have similar populations.
While the applicants wait for an answer, though, France does not provide them with any financial support or allow them to work  and the slow process can take many months.
The idea for the school was first touted by some of that group at the start of the summer, when they were bored with sitting around waiting and nervous about starting a new life in France totally unable to communicate.
It was a reality within weeks, opening on 11 July.
At its busiest, the tiny classroom holds 30 pupils, crammed into five rows of desks in front of a big green chalkboard and pictures of cartoon animals for each letter of the French alphabet.
French is not as easy as English but, two weeks ago, I decided there was no way to get to the UK, says George, another Darfur refugee and dedicated student.
Jenny Flahaut, 33, who works at a childrens home, was inspired to volunteer after seeing an advertisement on Facebook.
She is particularly frustrated by the depiction of migrants in the media and by politicians who have never visited the camp, most recently David Cameron, the British prime minister, who in a much criticized speech talked about swarms of people trying to reach the UK.
They dont know them and have a bad vision but they are not like that, Flahaut said as she prepared for an afternoon lesson.
The teachers and Zimarco are focused, now, on setting up a separate classroom to serve around 200 women and two dozen children.
When Larry Pizzi, a veteran bicycle industry executive, first heard about electric bikes nearly 20 years ago, he asked: Why would anyone want to screw up a bike by putting a motor and batteries on it?
Others in the industry agree.
Familiar brands including Trek, Raleigh and Specialized all offer electric models and theyre betting the market is about to take off.
Electric bikes are different from motorcycles or mopeds, which rely on motorized power; they are bicycles that can be pedalled with  or without  assistance from an electric motor.
While low-end models sell for as little as $700, Court Rye, the founder and editor of ElectricBikeReview.com, a popular website, says riders should expect to pay at least $1,500 for a quality e-bike with a good battery.
Companies like Bosch, the German electronics giant, and Shimano, the leading manufacturer of bicycle gears, are entering the business, which should help erode resistance from bike shops.
Perhaps most importantly, as more cities build cycling infrastructure, including dedicated bike lanes, bicycle commuting has become more popular.
Electric bikes make commuting more practical  and fun  by easing worry about hills, headwinds, fatigue and sweat.
Most of our customers are ageing baby boomers who want to rekindle the experience they had as a kid, says Pedegos Don DiCostanza.
CEO Craig Anderson says: We want to help reduce traffic, help reduce our carbon footprint and promote a healthy lifestyle.
Accell has great expectations about e-bikes in North America, Curries Larry Pizzi says.
While baby boomers are still a very important segment, were finding that a lot of younger people are using e-bikes for transportation, instead of cars.
Jordan Axani, a 28-year-old Toronto real-estate developer turned charity founder, made it back to Canada with Elizabeth Quinn Gallagher but said the pair had forged a brother-sister-like relationship.
Axani had made headlines in 2014 after offering an air ticket to any Canadian named Elizabeth Gallagher.
He had booked a three-week vacation with his ex-girlfriend but, after they split up, he was unable to change the name on the flights.
And her feelings are entirely mutual in that regard.
There was a certain amount of natural stumbling around the dos and donts of travelling together as the pair got to know each other.
At the end of it, wed developed a really great rhythm of, one second, having really funny inside jokes, and, the next second, knowing when the other needed space.
Although the pair failed to fall for one another, Axani said the trip, which took in Milan, Venice, Vienna, Prague, Khao Lak (in Thailand) and Hong Kong, was fantastic.
In terms of his love life, Axani said he was not looking for his next Elizabeth Gallagher just yet.
Im not looking for anything, per se, but life happens and well see, he said.
A companion had died at sea several months earlier, he said.
His condition isnt good, but hes getting better, said Ola Fjeldstad, a Norwegian anthropology student doing research on the isolated Ebon Atoll, part of the Marshall Islands archipelago.
The man had said his name was Jos Ivan and he had indicated that he survived by catching turtles and birds with his bare hands, but, because he spoke only Spanish, further details were sketchy.
The boat is really scratched up and looks like it has been in the water for a long time, Fjeldstad told reporters.
Officials at the ministry said that they were awaiting more details and expected the man to be taken to the capital.
Hes staying at the local council house and a family is feeding him, said Fjeldstad, who added that the man had a basic health check and was found to have low blood pressure, but did not appear to have any life-threatening conditions and was able to walk with the aid of men on the island.
Fraser Christian, who teaches maritime survival courses at his Coastal Survival School in Dorset, said the mans story, if true, would be remarkable but far from unique.
It was entirely possible to catch turtles or small fish by hand, he said, since they are inquisitive and they will approach a small boat to shelter underneath it.
Christian advises clients who find themselves forced to eat turtles to start with their eyes  lots of fluid  then move on to the blood.
On the parched grass not far from the India Gate monument at the centre of Delhi, they stretch, breathe and meditate.
Singh, a 42-year-old salesman, and his friends are far from alone.
All across India, in the overcrowded cities, on whatever green space is left, similar scenes are being played out.
Getting Indians, and others, stretching has emerged as something of a focus for Modi, who led his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to a landslide election victory in 2014.
In May 2015, schools were directed to make sure students attended yoga events timed to coincide with the big demonstration in Delhi, even though it is being held on a Sunday.
Air India, the national carrier, has also said it will introduce yoga for trainee pilots.
Modi, an ascetic who is a committed vegetarian and an enthusiastic yoga practitioner himself, suggested an international yoga day when speaking to the United Nations on a visit to New York in 2014.
Yoga is an invaluable gift of Indias ancient tradition.
It embodies unity of mind and body, thought and action, restraint and fulfilment, harmony between man and nature, a holistic approach to health and wellbeing.
A court in California ruled that: While the practice of yoga may be religious in some contexts, yoga classes as taught in the [San Diego] district are, as the trial court determined, devoid of any religious, mystical or spiritual trappings.
In ancient India, it was part of daily life, both the physical and the mental aspects.
Same with yoga.
Basfords intricately drawn pictures of flora and fauna in Secret Garden have sold 1.4 million copies worldwide to date, with the newly released follow-up Enchanted Forest selling just under 226,000 copies already.
They have drawn fans from Zooey Deschanel, who shared a link about the book with her Facebook followers, to the South Korean pop star Kim Ki- Bum, who posted an image on Instagram for his 1.6 million followers.
The last few weeks since Enchanted Forest came out have been utter madness, but fantastic madness, said Eleanor Blatherwick, head of sales and marketing at the books publisher, small British press Laurence King.
And it is not just Basford who is reaping the benefits of the hordes of adults who, it turns out, just wanted something to colour in.
In the UK, Richard Merritts Art Therapy Colouring Book sits in fourth spot on Amazons bestseller lists, Millie Marottas Animal Kingdom  detailed pictures of animals to colour  sits in seventh and a mindfulness colouring book sits in ninth.
Basfords titles are in second and eighth place  thats half of Amazon.co.uks top ten taken up by colouring books for adults.
At independent UK publisher Michael OMara, which has sold almost 340,000 adult colouring books to date, Head of Publicity, Marketing and Online, Ana McLaughlin, attributes the craze to the way the category has been reimagined as a means of relaxation.
The first one we did was in 2012, Creative Colouring for Grown- Ups.
It sold strongly and reprinted but it was in 2014 that it all really mushroomed with Art Therapy.
It really took off for us  selling the anti-stress angle gave people permission to enjoy something they might have felt was quite childish, she said.
I think it is really relaxing to do something analogue, to unplug, said Basford.
I had a kids book commissioned and I told them I would like to do one for grown-ups.
He owned a gold and silver Rolex and a fleet of expensive cars.
When police swooped on his warehouses in 2012 they found piles of cash: wads of 100, 200 and 500 notes were wrapped in elastic bands.
The gang, with Gao the alleged ringleader, stands accused of laundering up to 300m a year, as well as selling counterfeit goods and toys with fake safety marks.
Small and easy to transport relative to their value, they are the payment method of choice for tax dodgers, money launderers and drug barons.
The sum of 1m in 500 notes fits easily into a small laptop bag, where the same amount in 50 notes would require a small suitcase.
Other countries have limited their own highdenomination notes due to links to organized crime  Canada scrapped its $1,000 note in 2000 on the advice of law enforcement officers.
Peter Sands, the former head of Standard Chartered Bank, has called for the abolition of high-denomination notes, including the 500, the $100, the 1,000 Swiss Franc note and the 50.
At a conference on terrorist financing in London, the Head of Europol, Rob Wainwright, called on the European Central Bank (ECB) to look at whether it should continue to produce and circulate these notes that make it easier for criminals and terrorists to hide their business and to fund illegal activities.
According to Europol, the purple 500 note accounts for 30% of the value of all the euro notes in circulation, although most people have never seen one.
Cash remains king in Germany and Austria, where more than half of all transactions are made with paper money and coins.
Luxembourg, for example, issued more than twice its annual GDP in banknotes in 2013 alone, despite being one of the most cash-averse countries in Europe.
A modest cultural centre in the capital city, Havana, has suddenly become a rare source of free wi-fi.
The internationally renowned Cuban artist Kcho is providing the service.
But, in a country where only an estimated 5% of the population has unrestricted access to the internet, a facility that is both free of charge and free of restrictions is being hailed as an unprecedented boon.
The chance to click on international news websites, communicate with friends and family overseas and use sites like Facebook and Twitter has created a massive buzz.
Another estimate, that a quarter of Cubans have access to the internet  still one of the lowest penetration rates in the Western Hemisphere  in fact measures residents who use a restricted domestic intranet featuring only certain websites and limited email.
Its only possible through the will to do it and absorb the costs, Kcho told the Associated Press.
He gained international fame for his painting, sculpture and drawings after winning the grand prize at a prominent art biennial in South Korea.
Born on one of Cubas outlying islands, he is known for contemporary art with rustic, seaside and patriotic themes and imagery.
Kcho is estimated to be paying $900 a month to provide the free wi-fi.
A 2014 report by Akamai Technologies found average internet connectivity speeds to be around 10.5mbps in the US and 23.6mbps in world-leading South Korea.
With dozens of users at any given time, the signal strength of Kchos wi-fi gets diluted.
One user said he sometimes swings by in the middle of the night, when nobody else is around, and finds it to be unbelievably fast. 
Until the last, David Bowie, who has died of cancer, was still capable of springing surprises.
His latest album, Blackstar, appeared on his 69th birthday on 8 January 2016 and proved that his gift for making dramatic statements as well as challenging, disturbing music hadnt deserted him.
In 1953, the family moved to Kent, where David showed aptitude in singing and playing the recorder.
It was clear that Davids talents and ambition dictated that he should go solo.
David adopted the name Bowie to avoid confusion with Davy Jones of the Monkees.
In July 1969, Bowie released Space Oddity, the song that would give him his initial commercial breakthrough.
The albums themes included immortality, insanity, murder and mysticism, evidence that Bowie was a songwriter who was thinking way beyond pops usual boundaries.
He had his first UK number 1 album with Aladdin Sane (1973), which generated the hit singles The Jean Genie and Drive-in Saturday.
But Bowie was already planning fresh career moves.
Bowies relationship with his wife had been disintegrating under the pressures of success and the couple divorced in 1980.
This was a year of further creative triumph, bringing a fine album, Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps), and its spinoff chart-topping single, Ashes to Ashes, followed by Bowies well-received stint as John Merrick in The Elephant Man on the Broadway stage.
He achieved a number 1 single with his 1981 partnership with Queen, Under Pressure, while becoming increasingly involved in crossovers between different media.
Lets Dance moulded Bowie into a crowd-friendly global rock star, with the album and its singles Lets Dance, China Girl and Modern Love all becoming huge international hits.
In addition, he teamed up with Mick Jagger to record the fundraising single Dancing in the Street, which sped to number 1.
For the album Black Tie White Noise (1993), he sprinkled elements of soul, electronica and hip hop into the mix.
It topped the UK album chart and yielded a top 10 single, Jump They Say.
It contained the single Where Are We Now?, which gave him his first UK top 10 hit since 1993.
The album topped charts in Britain and around the world.
In 2014, Bowie was given the Brit Award for Best British Male, making him the oldest British recipient in the awards history.
Starting with Margaret Atwood, who handed over the manuscript of a text called Scribbler Moon in 2015, each year for the next 100 years, an author will deliver a piece of writing that will only be read in 2114, when the trees are chopped down to make paper on which the 100 texts will be printed.
Each author  their names revealed year by year and chosen by a panel of experts and Paterson, while she is alive  will make the trek to the spot in the forest high above Oslo, where they will surrender their manuscripts in a short ceremony.
What a historic fool of epochal proportions Id look if they opened it in 2114 and it wasnt any good.
Its ending, Rolled round in earths diurnal course / With rocks, and stones, and trees, felt appropriate in this small section of forest, carpeted with blueberry bushes, which will be carefully tended to for the next 98 years before it is turned into Future Librarys manuscripts.
Yet, how low-key and understated, to slave over a manuscript that nobody will ever pat you on the back for and say: Nice one or God, I loved the bit where she did that and he did this ... Mitchell wrote in a piece for the Future Library.
Watched over by a trust of experts until it is finally printed, it is now, says the novelist, as gone from me as a coin dropped in a river. 
Lima has black vultures or gallinazos.
In many ways, with their wrinkly heads and beady eyes, they remind Lima residents of the side of their city they would rather ignore: the neglect, poverty and filth.
Environmental authorities are giving these muchmaligned birds a PR makeover, kitting them out with GoPro action video cameras and GPS trackers, and giving them a new mission in the fight against fly-tipping and illegal dumping.
Fitted with his tracker, he is set free above the city, where he identifies clandestine dumps and records the GPS coordinates on a live map.
His trainer at Limas Huachipa Zoo, Alfredo Correa, beams with admiration.
They can eat dead animals because their metabolism protects them from viruses and bacteria, he says.
With just four landfills in a city of nearly ten million inhabitants, there are countless illegal dumps.
Run-off from the waste contaminates Limas main water source, the Rimac river, as well as the Chillon and Lurin rivers, which flow into the Bay of Lima.
Many residents, especially in the barrios, just dont pay.
It also means nobody is necessarily going to clean up where the vultures identify illegal rubbish.
The project aims to encourage citizens to be vultures on the ground: to report fly-tipping, cut back on their own waste and recycle.
Some residents are responding, posting photos of illicit dumps on the Twitter feed and Facebook page.
New regulations will introduce the tests to reveal what cars emissions are like when driving on roads and in traffic rather than in ideal, laboratory-like conditions, as is currently the case.
Pollutants from diesel engines such as nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide and particulates are thought to be responsible for at least one quarter of the 29,000 annual pollution-related deaths in the UK alone.
But the current New European Drive Cycle laboratory test for measuring these emissions is a quarter of a century old and has been outpaced by technological developments in the car industry.
Studies have shown that the results of lab techniques to measure car emissions can easily be fixed by using techniques such as taping up doors and windows to minimize air resistance, driving on unrealistically smooth roads and testing at improbably high temperatures.
The Commission is finalizing a proposal to introduce a new emissions testing procedure that will allow proper assessment of the vehicles in real driving, said Lucia Caudet, a Commission spokesperson.
One key reason why air pollution kills 400,000 citizens annually is that car makers cheat the tests for diesel cars, causing many times more pollution on the road, said Greg Archer, the clean vehicles manager for Transport and Environment.
EU states should now support the Commissions proposals and ignore the whingeing from car makers that the rules are too tough.
According to research by the International Council on Clean Transportation in 2014, actual nitrogen oxide emissions from cars are seven times higher than the 80mg/km standard, with some models running at 22 times above the recommended limit.
Only one car out of 16 met the 80g target.
Real Driving Emissions (RDE) is a totally new regulation that will force significant emission control hardware changes that may be demanded in the middle of a vehicles production lifetime, said Cara McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA).
ACEAs draft regulation would have covered fewer pollutants and further delayed the regulations phased introduction until 2020.
By 2017, the first real-world car emissions tests are expected to begin in earnest.
That evening, this woman was tickling Dustys tummy and it just looked so inviting.
Just after I got into the water, Dusty left the woman she was with and went ballistic  I found out afterwards that shes very territorial when she is with somebody.
Her tail was flapping wildly and, at first, I thought it was a display but, then, I twigged: maybe shes angry.
Then, another man appeared and said he was an orthopaedic surgeon who specialized in marine trauma.
I was in hospital for five days, in a back brace for several weeks and off work for five months with limited mobility, stiffness and pain.
I had craniosacral therapy, osteopathy and massage, and am building up my own osteopathy practice now.
If you see a ferocious animal coming at you with its teeth bared, its scary, but dolphins have this lovely, wide smile.
After the man pulled me out of the water, Dusty swam away but, then, she came back and was bobbing vertically next to me, looking at me.
We locked eyes and I felt there was complete remorse in her.
The threatened extinction of the tiger in India, the perilous existence of the orangutan in Indonesia, the plight of the panda: these are wildlife emergencies with which we have become familiar.
But, now, scientists fear the real impact of declining wildlife could be closer to home, with the threat to creatures such as ladybirds posing the gravest danger to biodiversity.
Climate change, declining numbers of animals, rising numbers of humans and the rapid rate of species extinction mean a growing number of scientists now declare us to be in the Anthropocene  the geological age of extinction when humans finally dominate the ecosystems.
The LPI showed the number of vertebrates had declined by 52% over four decades.
But its the creatures that provide the most natural capital or ecosystem services that are getting many scientists really worried.
Three quarters of the worlds food production is thought to depend on bees and other pollinators such as hoverflies.
The really interesting thing about this work is that we are learning that it s not just about the numbers of species going extinct, but the actual numbers in a population; that s the beginning of a fundamental shift in our understanding, he says.
The blame, most agree, sits with unsustainable human consumption damaging ecosystems, creating climate change and destroying habitats at a far faster rate than previously thought.
Humans, said TV naturalist Sir David Attenborough in 2013, are a plague on earth, but WWF claims there is still time to stop the rot.
We all  politicians, business and people  have an interest, and a responsibility, to act to ensure we protect what we all value: a healthy future for people and nature.
The Canadian tennis player Frank Dancevic slammed Australian Open organizers for forcing players to compete in inhumane conditions after he collapsed on court as temperatures rose to 41C.
He also said the heat had caused him to hallucinate: I was dizzy from the middle of the first set and then I saw Snoopy and I thought, Wow, Snoopy  thats weird.
Ive played five-set matches all my life and being out there for a set and a half and passing out with heat stroke, its not normal.
I, personally, dont think its fair and I know a lot of players dont think its fair.
I know when I went out to hit before the match, the conditions at 2.303pm were very, very tough.
It felt pretty hot, like youre dancing in a frying pan or something like that, she said.
Under a change to the rules for 2014, however, the decision on whether to stop matches at the tournament is now at the discretion of the tournament director, Wayne McKewen.
Organizers said temperatures peaked at 42.2C in the early evening on Tuesday and conditions had never reached the point where play would be stopped.
While conditions were hot and uncomfortable, the relatively low level of humidity ensured play would continue.
A ball boy had earlier required medical attention after collapsing during Milos Raonics 76, 61, 46, 62 victory over Daniel Gimeno-Traver on the equally exposed court eight and the tournament shortened rotations for the ball boys to 45-minute shifts.
Chinas Peng Shuai also said the heat had caused her to cramp up and vomit, and she had to be helped from the court after her 75, 46, 63 defeat to Japans Kurumi Nara.
A day that began with a fresh round of dawn raids on the Baur Au Lac hotel in Zurich ended with 16 football officials being indicted on corruption charges in the US, including five current or former members of FIFAs executive committee.
They included the notorious former Brazilian federation chief Ricardo Teixeira and his successor, Marco Polo Del Nero, who has recently stepped down from the FIFA executive committee.
They were among 16 individuals accused of fraud and other offences by the US Department of Justice as it set out a series of kickback schemes in a new 240-page indictment that superseded the previous one in May 2015.
The betrayal of trust set forth here is outrageous, the US Attorney General, Loretta Lynch, said.
The scale of corruption alleged herein is completely unacceptable.
Hawit only succeeded Jeffrey Webb in May 2015, after Webb was arrested as part of the US operation that threw FIFA into crisis and precipitated the downfall of Sepp Blatter.
Webbs predecessor, the controversial Jack Warner, was also seized in May.
The Swiss Federal Office of Justice said of the latest arrests: They are being held in custody pending their extradition.
The message from this announcement should be clear to every culpable individual who remains in the shadows, hoping to evade our investigation: you will not escape our focus, said Lynch.
Teixeira, the former son-in-law of the longstanding FIFA president Joo Havelange, was charged alongside Del Nero and his predecessor, Jos Maria Marin, who was charged in May.
He was then provisionally suspended alongside the UEFA President, Michel Platini, over an alleged 1.3m disloyal payment to the Frenchman.
Both men face possible life bans when their case is heard by the FIFA ethics committee in December if they are found guilty of the charges.
Among those also charged on Thursday were Rafael Salguero, a Guatemalan who left the executive committee in May; the former South American Confederation Secretary General, Eduardo Deluca; Perus former football federation president, Manuel Burga; and Bolivias football president, Carlos Chaves, already jailed in his own country.
Lynch said: The Department of Justice is committed to ending the rampant corruption we have described amidst the leadership of international football  not only because of the scale of the schemes alleged earlier and today, or the breadth of the operation required to sustain such corruption, but also because of the affront to international principles that this behaviour represents.
Appearing for the first time before the media since taking the role in September 2015, when Blatter was suspended, Hayatou responded in a similar way to his predecessors in improbably claiming the current crisis was down to a handful of errant individuals.
As the housing crisis bites, a fifth of young adults are staying in the family home until they are at least 26 and the same proportion are not paying a penny towards their keep.
While many around the country contributed financially, the survey found that 20% were paying nothing at all.
Young adults are being squeezed by low wages and rents, which have hit record highs, while those who want to buy a property are finding the monthly cost of renting is preventing them from saving enough to get on the housing ladder.
I dont really want to move out to rent as its more than a mortgage but you need such a big deposit to get a mortgage so its been a bit of a vicious circle.
Day does not want to share with strangers so his options are limited.
At home, he pays a nominal rent to cover bills and is able to keep the rest of his earnings from his job at a candle retailer.
Sue Green, of Saga, a business that sells insurance and products to the over-50s, said the majority of parents may not have planned to have their children living with them well into their 20s or 30s.
Most will be more than happy to house them in the family home rent-free because it might help their kids get on the property ladder sooner, she said.
Angus Hanton, co-founder of a thinktank called the Intergenerational Foundation, said older generations were the architects of the housing crisis and children should not be blamed for staying at home.
The under-30s have suffered a fall in average incomes of about 20% since the 2008 downturn.
Rents and car insurance have never been so high and mortgage lending rules have been tightened for the young but not for older buy-to-let investors, who squeeze out the young, he said.
Student-fee debt is rising rapidly yet many jobs on offer  zerohour and short-term contracts  are turning younger workers into second-class citizens.
Rather than blaming the young, we should be standing up for their interests so they can afford to build lives of their own.
But renting a one-bedroom flat would cost more than 420 a month before bills, which would take up a lot of her earnings.
They want me to try to save up and I contribute in other ways  I bring food in and I do things around the house.
She previously coached Benficas male youth teams, the Qatar womens team, which she led to its first international victory in 2012, and, more recently, the Iranian womens national side, which she left in September 2013.
Costa was appointed on a two-year contract by the president of Clermont Foot 63, Claude Michy, who is a champion at grabbing the headlines for his club.
She said: For the time being, I see too many men, even in the womens game, who are working, despite not having the same expertise as women, who, by contrast, are not working.
After doing work experience at Chelsea during her compatriot Jos Mourinhos first stint as manager of the club between 2004 and 2007, she was reportedly described as Mourinho in a skirt.
One of the biggest surprises was the discovery that there are mountains in the Kuiper belt, the solar systems mysterious third zone where Pluto sits amid around 100,000 smaller icy objects.
John Spencer, a mission scientist, said the mountains appear to be around 11,000ft high and several hundred miles across.
Weve brought what was previously a blurred point of light into focus, said Dwayne Brown, NASA spokesman, as scientists and journalists waited for the image to be unveiled.
They have already produced some surprises.
Scientists believe the mountains are made from water ice with just a thin veneer of exotic ices, methane and nitrogen.
The mountains on Pluto are likely to have formed no more than 100m years ago  extremely recently given the 4.56bn-year-old solar system.
This suggests the close-up region, which covers about 1% of Plutos surface, may still be geologically active.
For scale, the images are so detailed that, if the craft were flying over London, we would be able to pick out the runways at Heathrow airport.
The distance to Pluto  5bn km  means it takes New Horizons hours to send back a single picture and it will take 16 months to send all the data it has accumulated during the fly-by.
The team also announced that the heart-shaped feature visible on Pluto will now be known as the Tombaugh Regio, in honour of Clyde Tombaugh, who discovered the dwarf planet in 1930.
The image also shows a dramatic canyon estimated to be 7 to 9km deep.
Cathy Olkin, a mission scientist, said: Charon just blew our socks off when we had the new image today.
Then, its plutonium power source will run out and it will shut down, drifting outwards towards the edge of the solar system and deep space beyond.
We asked fi ve people doing some unusual jobs how much they are paid, what the worst parts are and why they enjoy their work.
Dog-food taster The job: Tasting dog food to make sure it meets a premium brands quality standards  What it involves: Opening sample tins of each freshly made batch of dog (or cat) food, smelling it and eating it.
Although dogs palates are different from ours, taste is an important quality check to ensure each different ingredient is perfectly balanced in just the right way, says Philip Wells, the chief taster for Lilys Kitchen pet food.
Its rewarding, Wells says, that a project he has worked on will help pets to become happier and healthier.
Hygiene technician The job: Disinfecting areas that have potentially been exposed to bio-hazardous situations  What it involves: Cleaning up crime scenes, road accidents and suicides.
Clearing hoarders houses full of rubbish, rats and excrement  among other things.
You get used to the job being disgusting but the emotional side of it is still hard.
Job satisfaction: Lewis fi nds the variety of tasks exciting.
One day, Im cleaning up after a dead body; another day, Im in a prison cell or 100 feet in the air being lowered down into a silo to clean it.
Biogas engineer The job: Setting up biogas plants in developing countries  What it involves: Linking a system of digesters  which can be fi lled with human excrement, animal dung and other waste products  to toilets to produce a biogas that can be used for cooking and lighting.
Typical salary: An entry-level salary is around 10,000, while a typical salary for a chief technical offi cer is 30,000.
Unsurprisingly, the anaerobic digestion (the process that takes place when bacteria eat the decomposing waste and produce methane) smells like rotten eggs.
Eel ecologist The job: Conserving the critically endangered European eel  What it involves: To monitor the size of the endangered eels, ecologists wade into the Thames and other London rivers and marshes full of eels, sometimes up to their armpits, and reach into a net fi lled with up to 20 adult eels to grab one with their bare hands.
Its diffi cult to look professional while crawling on the ground chasing an eel across the grass.
Worst part of the job: Eels are really tricky creatures to work with  and getting outsmarted by an eel can be quite embarrassing, says Mowat.
But, for Mowat, the worst part of the job is defi nitely not handling the eels  he believes baby eels (known as elvers) are as cute as pandas: The worst thing about the job is regularly learning how much damage we, the British population, are doing to the environment.
Eels are beautiful creatures and working with eels doesnt just benefi t the eel: it helps whole river systems, estuaries and coastal habitats.
That is something worth working on.
Shopping channel presenter The job: Selling and demonstrating a wide range of products on live TV  What it involves: Presenting hours and hours of monotonous content, while simultaneously demonstrating the products and appearing to be enthusiastic and knowledgeable about everything that youre selling.
An experienced presenter like myself generally gets to work prime-time hours, which means all weekends, bank holidays and very late evenings, plus the occasional 5am shift.
Discovered by researchers in Japan, Russia and the US, the four new elements are the first to be added to the periodic table since 2011, when elements 114 and 116 were included.
The new elements, all spectacularly short-lived and highly radioactive, complete the periodic tables seventh row and render science textbooks around the world out of date.
The US-based International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), the global organization that governs chemical nomenclature, terminology and measurement, verified the elements on 30 December, 2015 after poring over studies dating back to 2004.
The scientists who found them must now come up with formal names to replace the clunky Latinbased placeholders  ununtrium, ununpentium, ununseptium and ununoctium  which reflect their atomic numbers, 113, 115, 117, and 118.
The body awarded credit for the discovery of element 113, which had also been claimed by the Russians and Americans, to a team of scientists from the RIKEN Institute in Japan.
When elements 114 and 116 were assigned formal names in 2012, scientists chose flerovium and livermorium respectively, after the Flerov Lab at Dubnas Joint Institute of Research and the Lawrence Livermore Lab in the US, where the elements were discovered.
Jan Reedijk, president of the Inorganic Chemistry Division of IUPAC, said: The chemistry community is eager to see its most cherished table finally being completed down to the seventh row.
The Japanese team is believed to be considering three names for ununtrium: japonium, rikenium and nishinarium, after the Nishina Center for Accelerator-Based Science, where the element was found.
If we understand it better, hopefully we can do better at dealing with nuclear waste and things that are important in the real world.
Along with new names, the scientists must propose two-letter symbols for the elements.
In 1996, the symbol Cp was proposed for copernicium, or element 112, but it was swapped to Cn when scientists complained that Cp referred to another substance.
To discover the elements, researchers at the three labs slammed lighter nuclei into one another and looked for signature radioactive decays that should come from the new elements.
The fourth element, ununoctium, may be a noble gas, like other group-18 elements, helium, neon and argon.
The 140,000 ticket-holders are also being urged to bring reusable bottles that they can fill at 400 drinkingwater taps dotted across the site.
Environmentalists estimate that 150 million tonnes of plastic waste currently litters the planet and oceans, poisoning ecosystems and killing wildlife.
We do everything we can, but coping with the litter of 140,000 people is a challenge.
Smith said that, instead of buying bottled water, festival-goers should take advantage of the water on tap, which is being drawn from huge underground reservoirs, instead of old-fashioned water tanks that provided heavily chlorinated drinking water.
Despite the apparent British love of tea, consumption has more than halved since the 1970s, falling from 68g of tea per person per week to only 25g.
There has also been a dramatic shift from white to brown, wholemeal and other bread but the figures suggest the amount people are eating has fallen from 25 to 15 slices a week over the past four decades, based on a 40g slice from a medium sliced loaf.
The consumption of baked beans in sauce has dropped by a fifth despite a rise in other types of convenience food, particularly Italian dishes.
Some trends suggest that British people are becoming more prudent in what they put on their plates, with the average consumption of fruit, both fresh and processed, increasing by 50% since 1974.
Britons are spending a smaller proportion of pay on food today  11%, compared with 24% in 1974.
Shoppers are more plugged in to where their food comes from than ever before, the internet has brought quality produce to our doorsteps at the click of a button, pop-up restaurants are showcasing the latest trends and exciting global cuisines are now as common as fish and chips.
By opening up this data, we can look beyond what, where or how previous generations were eating and pinpoint the moments that changed our habits for good.
Weve only scraped the surface of what the National Food Survey can tell us and, from local food maps and school projects to predicting new food trends, I look forward to seeing how this data can be used to learn more about our past and grow our world-leading food and farming industry in the future. 
If we want to preserve them, we need to make sure that the digital objects we create today can still be rendered far into the future, he added.
The warning highlights an irony at the heart of modern technology, where music, photos, letters and other documents are digitized in the hope of ensuring their long-term survival.
But, while researchers are making progress in storing digital files for centuries, the programs and hardware needed to make sense of the files are continually falling out of use.
We are nonchalantly throwing all of our data into what could become an information black hole without realizing it.
We digitize things because we think we will preserve them but what we dont understand is that, unless we take other steps, those digital versions may not be any better, and may even be worse, than the artefacts that we digitized, Cerf says.
To study todays culture, future scholars would be faced with PDFs, Word documents and hundreds of other file types that can only be interpreted with dedicated software and sometimes hardware, too.
In 2005, American historian Doris Kearns Goodwin wrote Team of Rivals: the Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln, describing how Lincoln hired those who ran against him for presidency.
In todays world, those letters would be emails and the chances of finding them will be vanishingly small one hundred years from now, said Cerf.
Weve been surprised by what weve learned from objects that have been preserved purely by chance that give us insights into an earlier civilization, he said.
There, Mahadev Satyanarayanan takes digital snapshots of computer hard drives while they run different software programs.

Unveiling a car with a top speed of 25mph, two seats and no pedals or steering wheel might not make much of an impression at a motor show.
But Google, in the US, sent a minor earthquake through the car and taxi industries as it unveiled the latest version of its driverless car.
Instead, it has a smartphone app that summons it and tells it the destination, and a single STOP button mounted between the two front-facing seats in case the occupants need to override the computer.
The car, in fact, takes over all the tasks of navigation, steering, acceleration and braking.
The companys co-founder, Sergey Brin, told a conference in California that the vehicle was still in the prototype stage but that the project was about changing the world for people who are not well served by transportation today.
The cars, which have been built specially by a company (as yet unnamed) in Detroit, will be used to investigate further how best to make driverless vehicles work.
One challenge is creating high-definition scans of the roads and surroundings before the cars can drive along them because they cannot gather and process enough information in real time.
Google says it is interested in licensing the technology to traditional vehicle manufacturers once it has refined it sufficiently.
But the prospect of driverless cars replacing human-driven taxis has been the cause of some alarm.
But Chris Urmson, director of the self-driving car project at Google, said that the new prototypes dispensed with the steering wheel and brakes because there was no guarantee that a human occupant would be able to take over in an emergency, and that it was simpler just to have an emergency stop button.
And, thats an important step towards improving road safety and transforming mobility for millions of people.
So far, the Google versions of the self-driving cars have covered 700,000 miles without an accident caused by the computer.
The company points out that thousands of people die each year on the roads and that about 80% of crashes can be ascribed to human error.
An atmosphere of melancholy and changing times pervades the opening to the final series of Downton Abbey.
Now, without doubt, it is loved by millions of other people.
But, a restoration project of derelict tower rooms has begun that will eventually allow visitors to climb up into the tower to an exhibition showcasing the work of the architect of the Houses of Parliament, Sir Charles Barry, who rebuilt the house between 1839 and 1842.
Lord Carnarvon said then: It was just after the banking crisis and it was gloom in all directions.
Visitor numbers doubled, to 1,200 a day, as Downton Abbey, scripted by Julian Fellowes, came to be screened around the world after becoming a hit in the UK in 2010 and, then, in the US.
Peter Fincham, ITVs director of television, recalls the moment when Highclere was booked.
VisitBritain estimates that nearly 30% of foreign visitors, or nearly nine million people, include castles and historic houses on their itineraries.
VisitBritains director, Patricia Yates, said: The links between tourism, films and TV are potent ones.
Really, it is a fantasy world, based in a particular time in history.
Its the first TV period drama that has really leapt out of the screen and become part of popular culture.
Lady Carnarvon is still keen to emphasize that the long-term future of Highclere is not necessarily secure.
Perhaps, in the past, an estate and house defined and supported the family and their lifestyle but, today, it is quite the reverse: the challenge is how Geordie and I seek to support and look after Highclere.
In my new role, day shifts were spent on the streets in political rallies and nights were spent alone in the offi ce, coordinating the coverage from strifetorn El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala and the rest of Central America.

The whole situation, said Tristan Cardew, with very British understatement, is really rather silly.
With his Icelandic wife, Kristin, Cardew is appealing against a decision by the National Registry in the capital Reykjavik not to renew their ten-year-old daughter Harriets passport on the grounds that it does not recognize her first name.
The impasse meant the family, from Kpavogur, risked missing their holiday in France until they applied to the British embassy for an emergency UK passport, which should now allow them to leave.
Names matter in Iceland, a country of barely 320,000 people, whose phone book lists subscribers by their first name for the very sensible reason that the vast majority of Icelandic surnames simply record the fact that you are your fathers (or mothers) son or daughter.
Jn Einarssons offspring, for example, might be lafur Jnsson and Sigrur Jnsdttir.
The law dictates that the names of children born in Iceland must  unless both parents are foreign  be submitted to the National Registry within six months of birth.
For the 5,000 or so children born in Iceland each year, the committee reportedly receives about 100 applications and rejects about half under a 1996 act aimed mainly at preserving the language of the sagas.
Among its requirements are that given names must be capable of having Icelandic grammatical endings, may not conflict with the linguistic structure of Iceland and should be written in accordance with the ordinary rules of Icelandic orthography.
The countrys naming laws have come under increasing fire in recent years: in 2013, Blr  Light Breeze  Bjarkardttir Rnarsdottir won the right to be officially known by her given name, as opposed to Girl, when a court ruled that denying her was a violation of the Icelandic constitution.

An octopus has made a brazen escape from the National Aquarium in New Zealand by breaking out of its tank, slithering down a 50-metre drainpipe and disappearing into the sea.
Staff believe that in the middle of the night, while the aquarium was deserted, Inky clambered to the top of his glass enclosure, down the side of the tank and travelled across the floor of the aquarium.
Rob Yarrell, national manager of the National Aquarium of New Zealand in Napier, said: Octopuses are famous escape artists.
I dont think he was unhappy with us, or lonely, as octopuses are solitary creatures.
He would want to know whats happening on the outside.
One theory is that Inky slid across the aquarium floor  a journey of three or four metres  and then, sensing freedom was at hand, into a drainpipe that led directly to the sea.
The drainpipe was 50 metres long and opened onto the waters of Hawkes Bay, on the east coast of New Zealands North Island.
Another possible escape route could have involved Inky squeezing into an open pipe at the top of his tank, which led under the floor to the drain.
Reiss Jenkinson, exhibits keeper at the National Aquarium, said he was absolutely certain Inky had not been taken.
I understand the nature of octopus behaviour very well, he said.
I have seen octopuses on boats slip through bilge pumps.
Because octopuses have no bones, they are able to fit into extremely small spaces and have been filmed squeezing through gaps the size of coins.
They are also understood to be extremely intelligent and capable of using tools.
Inky was brought to the National Aquarium a number of years ago by a local fisherman who found him caught in a crayfish pot.
He was very friendly, very inquisitive and a popular attraction here.
OK, so regretting making Flappy Bird isnt quite the same as regretting making a rifl e, but Nguyen is just the latest in a long line of inventors who wish they hadnt created a monster.
The labradoodle The labradoodle isnt a monster  its adorable, obviously.
But whats monstrous is the way crossbreed dogs have been bred and marketed since the labradoodles inventor, Wally Conron, fi rst created the breed in the 1980s.
What he didnt expect was that the labradoodle  and its other poodle-cross variants, many of which have health problems  would become so popular.
One and the same question: if my rifl e killed people, does that mean that I, Mikhail Kalashnikov, 93 years of age, the son of a peasant, Christian and Orthodox by faith, am responsible for peoples deaths, even if they were enemies?
Electronic tagging The electronic tag was originally conceived in the 1960s as a way of tracking former prisoners attendance at schools and workplaces, and rewarding them for good behaviour.
I have never seen such an inappropriate and improper use of chemical agents, Kamran Loghman told The New York Times.
JMW Turner, one of Britains greatest painters, is to be the face of the new 20 note, following a nationwide vote.
It will be the first time an artist has appeared on a British banknote, after the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, asked the public to nominate a deceased cultural figure they felt deserved the high honour.
Turner, renowned for his dramatic seascapes, beat off competition from 590 painters, sculptors, fashion designers, photographers, film-makers and actors put forward by 30,000 members of the public.
The final five  Barbara Hepworth, Charlie Chaplin, Josiah Wedgwood, William Hogarth and Turner  were selected on the basis of their unquestioned contribution to both the visual arts and British society as a whole, as well as their enduring influence.
It was 1786, when he was sent to Margate, that his love affair with painting and drawing the north-east Kent coast began.
He would return to that coast throughout his life and it was where he painted some of his most dramatic oils and watercolours, describing its skies as the loveliest in all Europe.
Turner was a particularly prolific artist, producing more than 550 oil paintings and 2,000 watercolours over his lifetime.
His life was also the subject of a film, in 2014, by Mike Leigh, with Timothy Spall taking on the role of the complex artist.
Victoria Pomery, the director of Turner Contemporary, said: The decision to celebrate JMW Turner, one of the greatest technical pioneers in the history of British art, is extraordinary, not least because it has proven by a public vote that Turner is the nations favourite artist.
While many British workers regard a two-week summer holiday as an inalienable right, workers in Japan have come to see a four-night vacation in Hawaii as the height of self-indulgence.
Japans low birth rate and predictions of rapid population decline are partly blamed on the lack of time couples have to start families.
About 22% of Japanese work more than 49 hours a week, compared with 16% of US workers and 11% in France and Germany, according to data compiled by the Japanese government.
In spending 14 hours a day at work and giving up many of her paid holidays, Erika Sekiguchi is not even an extreme example.
The 36-year-old trading company employee used eight of her 20 days of paid vacation in 2014, six of which counted as sick leave.
Yuu Wakebe, a health ministry official overseeing policy on working hours, who admits putting in 100 hours of overtime a month, blames the irresistible pressure to match ones colleagues, hour for hour.
That fear of being ostracized at work is being blamed for a rise in stress-related illness, premature death and suicide.
According to official data, about 200 people die every year from heart attacks, strokes and other karoshi events brought on by punishing work schedules.
It will also encourage staff and customers to join up with their local branch of the charity to care for elderly people who might otherwise be alone over the holiday.
The retailer has spent 7m on a campaign that ranges from the slick TV ad to a smartphone game and merchandise, including glow-in-thedark pyjamas, as well as areas decked out like the surface of the moon in 11 stores.
After two years of successful ads featuring cuddly animals  a bear and hare, then a penguin  this time, the retailer is tugging at the heartstrings with a story of a young girl, Lily, who spots an old man living in a shack on the moon through her telescope.
The determined child tries sending him a letter and firing a note via bow and arrow, before floating him a present of a telescope tied to balloons, which finally enables them to make contact.
The ads strapline is: Show someone theyre loved this Christmas, which echoes Age UKs own campaign: No one should have no one at Christmas.
The charity really resonates with people at this time of year and the ad lends itself to thinking about someone who lives on your street that might not see anybody, said Rachel Swift, head of marketing at John Lewis.
The campaign features the Oasis track Half the World Away reinterpreted by little-known Norwegian artist Aurora.
There will be a full moon on Christmas Day 2015  a complete coincidence, according to Swift.
It had drummed up 22m views on YouTube by the first week of January, ahead of the 16.6m clocked by Sainsburys ad featuring First World War soldiers sharing a bar of chocolate, the UKs next most popular ad of 2014.
Swift said that, despite the hype, John Lewis had stuck to the same strategy for the last five years.
Sarah Vizard, news editor of trade journal Marketing Week, said John Lewis appeared to have reined in its efforts this time, with a lowerkey presence in stores despite a growing army of competitors.
This campaign is another great way of putting that across in a way that will resonate with customers.
Prior to her highly anticipated series of concerts at the Hammersmith Apollo in London, Bush released a statement appealing to her fans to put down their mobile phones at her gigs.
With her love of theatrics and opulent costumes, Bushs keenness to stop fans uploading grainy footage to YouTube could also be an attempt to keep the show a surprise for the thousands of fans who have purchased tickets for the 22 dates she is playing.
You cant even sing because youre too busy taping, Beyonc told him.
Recently, Dutch fans at PSV Eindhoven launched a vehement protest against the introduction of wi-fi in their stadium, holding up banners with messages like No wi-fi.
Support the team, You can sit at home, and Stand united, while Manchester United have also told fans to leave their large electronic devices at home, prohibiting filming on tablets this season.
Jarvis Cocker has previously criticized phonewielders in the audience for driving him insane at concerts, adding: It seems stupid to have something happening in front of you and look at it on a screen thats smaller than the size of a cigarette packet.
It has even filtered into the world of classical music, with one of the worlds leading pianists surprising concert-goers in June 2013 when he stormed off stage because a fan was filming his performance on a smartphone.
Krystian Zimerman returned moments later and declared: The destruction of music because of YouTube is enormous.
But Sam Watt of Vyclone, a phone app that encourages audiences to film at concerts and then brings together the footage to create a crowd-sourced video of the event, said that such artists were fighting a losing battle and that filming at concerts enhanced rather than detracted from the experience.
Fans filming is now part of the concert experience  that is a just a fact  so we take that footage that people are filming at concerts through the app, they upload it onto the app, and then it comes back to them mixed together with everybody else who was filming.
Our overall thinking is that filming at concerts adds to the experience, rather than taking away from it and I think, if Kate Bush came round for a cup of tea, we could have a really interesting discussion about this and we might be able to win her round, he added.
But thats exactly what Kiruna, an Arctic town in northern Sweden, is having to do  to avoid being swallowed up into the earth.
We are symbiotic: the town is here because of the mine, says Deputy Mayor Niklas Siren.
Otherwise, no devil would have built a city here.
In 2004, the mining company broke it to the town that its days were numbered: digging its shafts towards the city at an angle of 60 degrees, subsidence would soon lead to the widespread cracking and collapse of the towns buildings.
After years of dithering, the city has finally unveiled a master plan for how it will proceed.
Kirunas rust-red wooden church, built in 1912 in a form that recalls the indigenous Sami teepees, and once voted Swedens most beautiful building, will take pride of place in a new park, while the castiron bell tower will stand once again above the town hall.
Its things like that  the hospital where your first child was born, for example  that are important to peoples sense of identity and all thats going to disappear.
Billed as the most democratic move in history, the project has been allocated the equivalent of 320m by the mining company for building new facilities, including a high school, fire station, community centre, library and swimming hall.
People are used to very low rents and very high incomes but, in future, this will have to change.
LK has agreed to compensate residents to the value of their homes plus 25% but many locals say this is not enough to afford a new-build house at market rates.
But it is a vision that many of the existing residents seem unlikely to be able to afford. 
The Danish toy firms sales rose across Europe, the Americas and Asia as children snapped up products linked to the film.
The film, released in February, took more than $250m in the US and 31m in the UK by the first weekend in April.
Lego, based in the small town of Billund, started producing its plastic bricks in 1949 and became a staple childrens toy around the world by the 1970s.
The company opened its first factory in China in April and opened an office in Shanghai to spearhead expansion in the worlds secondbiggest economy. 
Meanwhile, research by Professor John Cacioppo at the University of Chicago has found loneliness to be twice as bad for older peoples health as obesity and almost as great a cause of death as poverty.
But, shocking as this is, such studies overlook the loneliness epidemic among younger adults.
In 2010, the Mental Health Foundation found loneliness to be a greater concern among young people than the elderly.
Loneliness is a recognized problem among the elderly  there are day centres and charities to help them, says Sam Challis, an information manager at the mental health charity Mind, but, when young people reach 21, theyre too old for youth services.
This is problematic because of the close relationship between loneliness and mental health  it is linked to increased stress, depression, paranoia, anxiety, addiction, cognitive decline and is a known factor in suicide.
People present an idealized version of themselves online and we expect to have social lives like those portrayed in the media, says Challis.
Comparing friends seemingly perfect lives with ours can lead us to withdraw socially.
Indeed, a study of social media at the University of Michigan in 2013 found that, while Facebook reduces life satisfaction, using technology to help you meet new people can be beneficial.
One in four men who call the emotional support charity Samaritans mention loneliness or isolation and Get Connected is a free confidential helpline for young people, where they can seek help with emotional and mental health issues often linked to loneliness.
Greater openness with his employer and colleagues made his return to work easier.
Office chit-chat may seem like a waste of time, but it helps to cushion us from the emotional and psychological effects of work strain.
We treat the networks we have as incidental but theyre fundamental to our well-being, says Nicky Forsythe, a psychotherapist and the founder of Talk for Health, a social enterprise that trains people to give and receive peer support in groups.
Getting older doesnt have to mean getting lonelier, says Ruth Sutherland, the chief executive of the relationship counselling service Relate, in a new report.
The scientists behind the research said a course of oxytocin might boost the success of behavioural therapies that are already used to help people with autism learn to cope with social situations.
Autism is a developmental disorder seen in more than one in 100 people.
Researchers at Yale have studied the brain chemical oxytocin as a potential treatment for the social impairments caused by autism because it plays a crucial role in bonding and trust.
Results have been mixed, though: one recent study found no significant benefit for youths given the chemical over several days.
But Pelphrey said oxytocin might help the brain learn from social interactions; it would work best when used with therapies that encourage people with autism to engage more socially, he said.
The scans were given 45 minutes after the participants inhaled a placebo or oxytocin through a nasal spray.
The scans showed that reward circuitry in the childrens brains behaved more normally after a snort of oxytocin, being more active when the person was looking at faces and less active when viewing the inanimate cars.
He warned that it was too early to use oxytocin as a treatment for the social difficulties caused by autism and cautioned against buying oxytocin from suppliers online.
This is an important new study in identifying changes in brain activity in key regions of the brain involved in social cognition in autism following oxytocin administration, said Simon Baron-Cohen, director of the Autism Research Centre at Cambridge University.
A surprising finding, however, is that oxytocin nasal spray did not change performance on the social cognitive task.
Doctors should be cautious about the clinical potential of this hormone until we know much more about its benefits and risks, in much larger studies.
Uta Frith, who studies autism at University College London, said: According to this study, oxytocin may have the effect of making faces more interesting as assessed by greater activity in brain structures concerned with reward evaluation.
Charles Gant, film editor for Heat magazine, says the indications are it is heading in the right direction.
It was cleverly positioned as simultaneously modern and retro.
A director principally known for character studies such as American Beauty and Revolutionary Road, Mendes has taken the Bond series to new heights.
Gant says: Mendes managed to engage with both the modern and the traditional Bond audience, and he also pulled in high-calibre actors like Ralph Fiennes.
Though the Bond series was not in trouble before Mendess arrival  and Craigs  there was the sense of a certain amount of staleness towards the end of Pierce Brosnans run.
This cycle, however, was nothing new: the history of the Bond series has been one of ebb and flow, stasis and renewal, revolving most obviously around the lead actor: first, Sean Connery; then, successively, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Brosnan and, now, Craig.
Lazenby only lasted a single film, while Daltons two efforts, The Living Daylights and Licence to Kill coincided with a period in the late 80s when the 007 movie had been thoroughly eclipsed by more aggressive, slickly produced Hollywood action movies.
According to Gant, the period of Roger Moores last ones, going into Dalton, didnt really excite audiences.
With figures adjusted for inflation, the 1965 release, Thunderball, is only a hairs breadth below Skyfall, while Goldfinger and You Only Live Twice both outperformed the other Craig films (as did the 70s Bonds, The Spy Who Loved Me and Live and Let Die).
Benjamin Carle is 96.9% made in France, right down to his underpants and socks.
Carle, 26, set out, in 2013, to see if it was possible to live using only French-made products for ten months as part of a television documentary.
The experiment cost Carle his smartphone, television, refrigerator (all made in China); his spectacles (Italian); his underpants (Moroccan); morning coffee (Guatemalan) and his adored David Bowie music (British).
Fortunately, his long-suffering girlfriend, Anas, and cat, Loon, (both French) stuck with him.
Politicians say all sorts of things and expect us to go along with it.
He set just three rules: eat only foods produced in France, eliminate contact with foreign-made goods and do so on 1,800 a month (above the minimum wage of 1,430 to cover the extra expense of living in Paris).
The journalist was shocked to find out at the start of the experiment that only 4.5% of the contents of his flat were made nationally  and that the rest would have to go, including the lightbulbs (China) and green beans (Kenya).
Left without a refrigerator (none are made in France) or nail clippers, he was forced to chill his food on the window ledge and saw at his toenails with a penknife.
His foreign-made clothes, down to his underwear, were replaced with more expensive alternatives: French-produced underpants (26), socks (9), polo shirt (75), espadrille sandals (26), but no jeans as none are produced in France.
During the experiment, Carle scoured supermarket shelves for 100% French-made products, learned to cook seasonal fruit and vegetables grown in France, proudly brushed his teeth with the last toothbrush made in France by a company in Picardie employing 29 people and hand-washed his smalls until he found the last French-made washing machine (which, being top opening, would not fit under the kitchen counter).
Going out with friends was problematic  no American films, no Belgian beer, no sushi or pizza.
Staying home, with no sofa for the first few months and no television, meant listening to crooner Michel Sardou and reading French novels.
French wine was, of course, allowed and French-Canadian singer Cline Dion, but not, according to his advisers, French bands such as Daft Punk, who sing in English.
Unable to use his British-made bicycle or even a French car after discovering the only affordable Peugeot, Renault and Citron models are mostly made overseas, he invested in a fug-emitting orange Mobylette moped.
At one point, he consults a French language expert to check if he should be using cool and other Anglicisms  he was advised to swap it for the nearest French equivalent: chouette.
On discovering France makes no refrigerators (apart from wine coolers) or televisions, but is big in aeroplane seats and windmills, he sighs and says: Great.
It was trying to show that we should reflect about the way we consume and make different choices, and that applies in all countries.
He is not the first person to express scepticism about Mars One, a vastly ambitious private mission aiming to settle humans on Mars from 2025.
Roche, an astrophysicist at Trinity College Dublin who was announced in February as among the 100 people in line for the mission, has written for the Guardian expressing his grave doubts about the viability of Mars One.
The selection process, Roche writes, was not rigorous enough to reach the requisite standard of more traditional astronaut selection programmes.
Roche also expressed worries about the way the mission organizers publicized a so-called top-ten candidates.
The official timeline for the mission says the group plans to dispatch a stationary lander and satellite to Mars in 2018, followed by a rover in 2020 and cargo missions starting in 2022.
In February, a prominent supporter of the project, Gerard t Hooft, a Dutch Nobel laureate in physics, said he did not believe this timetable was realistic.
But then they made us sign a non-disclosure agreement if we wanted to be interviewed and then, all of a sudden, it changed from being a proper regional interview over several days to being a ten-minute Skype call.
If a one-way mission to Mars ever became possible, then I would always volunteer.
And so, like seemingly everyone in Silicon Valley, the 27-year-old venture capitalist has come up with a start-up to fix it: BetterBoyfriend.me, a service that sends girlfriends and wives a present every month for about $70.
He tests his ideas by buying Facebook ads just to see what kind of traction they get.
Another start-up, called InvisibleBoyfriend, allows users to design and build a believable social partner who is everything you want and is always available to talk, whenever you want.
Founder Kyle Tabor launched it to give users a faux boyfriend to deter unwanted advances but has found people have grown attached to their algorithmic partners: Many more users are seeking companionship through conversation rather than external proof of a relationship to get people off their back.
Early on, the packages included receipts that had his name on them, Dan Sullivan.
One of the boyfriends wrote to me and said, Listen, dude, shes not mad but Cynthia found out."
I looked for couples and gave the bouquet to the girl but that didnt go down well with the boyfriend.
The last major United Nations (UN) assessment, in 2007, predicted runaway temperature rises of 6 C or more by the end of the century.
As temperatures climb and oceans warm, tropical and subtropical regions will face sharp changes in annual rainfall, says the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, released in Stockholm and published online in September.
East Africa can expect to experience increased short rains, while west Africa should expect heavier monsoons.
Scientists in developing countries and commentators have welcomed the report, which they said backed their own observations.
The IPCC makes the case that climate change is real and happening much more strongly than before.
They do not need the IPCC to tell them that the weather is changing, said Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development, based in Dhaka.
Although the global frequency of tropical cyclones is expected to decrease or remain essentially unchanged, they may become more intense, with stronger winds and heavier rainfall.
Life in many developing-country cities could become practically unbearable, given that urban temperatures are already well above those in surrounding countryside.
The charity Oxfam predicted that world hunger would worsen as climate changes inevitably hurt crop production and disrupt incomes.
The changing climate is already jeopardizing gains in the fi ght against hunger, and it looks set to worsen, said Oxfam.
This season, criticism of referees has increased to the point where some former referees have felt compelled to complain about standards.
That is quite striking because, the more you talk to referees, the more obvious it is that supporting each other through thick and thin is fundamental.
A glimpse of an answer appears on the face of Lee Swabey moments after he blows the final whistle of a 21 win for Grimsby over Woking, a match at level 5 of the English league system.
A few weeks earlier, Riley, Dunn and another former referee, Peter Jones, made their way to another level-5 match to monitor another referee tipped to progress  John Brooks.
It is all part of the experience Brooks needs to acquire before he is trusted with more high-profile games, the different problems that need dealing with  often, clubs are very reluctant to have a late postponement, particularly when they have to pay all the staff who have turned up but will not receive any gate money.
A little later, the football club secretary arrived with envelopes to pay the officials for their time  the match fee at level 5 is 95 so it is safe to assume these men do not do it for the cash.
The former referees agree that the backup, education and tools that todays referees have is a world away from what they experienced in their own days.
Riley, as a young referee, went out and bought himself books on psychology and nutrition as there was no information on offer to him at all.

Riley, as a young referee, went out and bought himself books on psychology and nutrition as there was no information on offer to him at all.
Contrast this with Brooks, who has a coach at the end of the phone.
Liam has taught us some techniques for releasing that decision.
We are all in favour of anything that makes the referees job better and makes them more effective on the field of play, says Riley.
A mirror that sends heat into the frigid expanse of space has been designed by scientists to replace air-conditioning units that keep buildings cool on Earth.
Researchers believe the mirror could slash the amount of energy used to control air temperatures in business premises and shopping centres by doing away with power-hungry cooling systems.
You can signi cantly offset the electricity used for air conditioning, said Shanhui Fan, an expert in photonics at Stanford University, who led the development of the mirror.
Hot-water boilers and cooking facilities release heat into their immediate surroundings.
The Stanford mirror was designed in such a way that it re ects 97% of the visible light that falls on it.
To make anything cool requires what engineers call a heat sink: somewhere to dump unwanted heat.
The Stanford mirror relies on the ultimate heat sink: the universe itself.
The mirror is built from several layers of wafer-thin materials.
On top of this are alternating layers of silicon dioxide and hafnium oxide.
These layers improve the re ectivity but, also, turn the mirror into a thermal radiator.
When silicon dioxide heats up, it radiates the heat as infrared light at a wavelength of around ten micrometres.
In tests, the mirror had a cooling power of 40 watts per square metre at ambient temperature.
Im really excited by the potential it has and the applications for cooling, said Marin Solja__i__, a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

The project is a key plank in Moroccos ambitions to use its untapped deserts to become a global solar superpower.
In the days after the Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986, the German particle physicist Gerhard Knies calculated that the worlds deserts receive enough energy in a few hours to provide for humanitys power needs for a whole year.
As engineers put the  nishing touches to Noor 1, its 500,000 crescent-shaped solar mirrors glitter across the desert skyline.
When they are  nished, the four plants at Ouarzazate will occupy a space as big as Moroccos capital city, Rabat, and generate 580 mega-watts (MW) of electricity, enough to power a million homes.
Moroccos Environment Minister, Hakima el-Haite, believes that solar energy could have the same impact on the region this century that oil production had in the last.
We import 94% of our energy as fossil fuels from abroad and that has big consequences for our state budget, el-Haite told the Guardian.
Solar energy will make up a third of Moroccos renewable energy supply by 2020, with wind and hydro taking the same share each.
Technicians say that the Noor 2 and 3 plants, due to open in 2017, will store energy for up to eight hours  opening the prospect of 24/7 solar energy in the Sahara and the surrounding region.
We are already involved in high tension transportation lines to cover the full south of Morocco and Mauritania as a  rst step, says Ahmed Baroudi, manager of Societe dInvestissements Energetiques, the national renewable energy investment  rm.
Whether that ambition is achieved remains to be seen but exporting solar energy could have stabilizing effects within and between countries, according to the Moroccan solar energy agency (Masen).
In the meantime, Morocco is focused on using solar to meet its own needs for resource independence.
One month before launch, over a thousand, mostly Moroccan, workers are still racing to  x electric wires, take down scaffolding and wrap rockwool insulation around steel pipelines.
Music subscription services, including Spotify and Deezer, have broken through the $1bn sales barrier worldwide, as increasing numbers of fans choose to pay for music online.
Streaming and subscription revenues rose by more than 50% in 2013 to reach $1.1bn, helping overall sales of recorded music in Europe grow for the  rst time in 12 years, according to  gures published in March 2014.
There are now an estimated 450 music-rental services around the world, and, while many people still listen for free, a desire for more choice is persuading more music lovers to part with their cash.
Easily accessible from smartphones and tablets, subscription services are popular with people looking to try out new music without committing to buying a download or a CD.
The IFPI also said that One Direction were the biggest-selling artists of 2013, with 4m physical and digital sales for their Midnight Memories album.
There are signs that, in Britain and America, streaming may soon generate more revenue for the music industry than downloads from online stores such as Apples iTunes.
Subscription services now account for a third of all digital sales globally, with downloads making up the balance, but the IFPI data shows that the two formats are growing at different rates.
In the US, the percentage of people claiming to use subscription and streaming rose from 19% in 2012 to 23%, while the percentage of people downloading fell from 28% to 27%.
Digital formats now account for 39% of all music sales, or nearly 5.9bn out of 15bn, and, while sales of CDs and vinyl declined steeply in 2013, they still contribute just over half the industrys income.
However, vinyl continued to make a comeback in some markets.
Shes been timing the progression of the queue on her phone ... and is that a tiny camera lens peeking out from her purse?
Im always given a scenario, such as buying something from a speci c department or a new product range, but, within that framework, I can often buy whatever I want  and keep it.
Her income is typically 30,000 to 40,000 a year and that doesnt include all the freebies she gets on the job.
She does, however,  nd it satisfying to return to a store she has previously mystery shopped and see standards have improved.
Its estimated that more than 500,000 people have registered as mystery shoppers in the UK, but just 10% or less manage to get regular work each month and this has led to a dramatic reduction in compensation.
Nowadays, mystery shopping companies mostly rely on the promise of freebies to incentivize their workers.
At the most, well pay 15 to 25 plus reimbursement for, say, a meal for two or a hotel stay.
Hannah, a 41-year-old City lawyer, has conducted nearly 500 visits for the Mystery Dining Company in her spare time without receiving remuneration or travel expenses.
The veteran of past missions said that his biggest surprise was simply how long this one felt.
Kelly said the length of the mission was its biggest challenge and that he felt signi cantly more sore on returning to gravity than after shorter trips.
It was the fresh air mingled with the charred, kind of sweet smell of a spacecraft that had survived re-entry through the atmosphere.
The ISS, he said, is a place that uses the power of the sun and was built with the help of an international team and millions of taxpayers.
The Earth is a beautiful planet, he said, describing the striking colours of the waters around the Bahamas and the rainbow hues of lakes that dot the northern Himalayas.
Besides the news, he said, steady work helped keep him sane: I tried to have milestones that were close, like when is the next crew arriving, the next spacewalk, the next robotics, the next science experiment.
That made a difference to me, keeping my sanity.
Therell be a point here pretty soon where Ill start feeling that kind of culture shock, he said.
But I dont think I would ever say Im absolutely, 100% done, he added, noting the sudden successes of private space ight companies such as SpaceX.
Scientists have created an atlas of the brain that reveals how the meanings of words are arranged across different regions of the organ.
Together, they make up networks that represent the meanings of each word we use: life and love, death and taxes, clouds, Florida and bra.
It is possible that this approach could be used to decode information about what words a person is hearing, reading or possibly even thinking, said Alexander Huth, the  rst author on the study.
They then matched the transcripts of the stories with the brain activity data to show how groups of related words triggered neural responses in 50,000 to 80,000 pea-sized spots all over the cerebral cortex.
Per person, that amounted to hearing roughly 25,000 words  and more than 3,000 different words  as they lay in the scanner.
The atlas shows how words and related terms exercise the same regions of the brain.
Each word is represented by more than one spot because words tend to have several meanings.
One part of the brain, for example, reliably responds to the word top, along with other words that describe clothing.
Armed with the atlas, researchers can now piece together the brain networks that represent wildly different concepts, from numbers to murder and religion.
Unlike many studies that looked at brain activity when an isolated word or sentence was spoken, Gallants team had shed light on how the brain worked in a real- world scenario, he said.
Ultimately, Hasson believes it will be possible to reconstruct the words a person is thinking from their brain activity.
But, the brain atlas in its current form does not capture  ne differences in word meanings.

As the Wall Street Journal recently reported, New Orleans city government has, since Hurricane Katrina in 2005, begun trying to turn down the volume a bit.
With the support of neighbourhood groups, the city has begun policing bars and nightclubs more strictly, while, at the same time,  ghting to implement a new noise ordinance (read: music ordinance).
This is just the wrong time for them to have pursued something like this, complains bar- owner William Walker, who, for reasons of personal choice, hates the anti-smoking law.
Forcing people outside the bar to smoke is going to exacerbate the tension thats already there.
Many of New Orleanss best bars and some of its live music spots are in relatively quiet residential neighbourhoods.
Recently, though, this unique social contract has become unacceptable for some people and the fate of New Orleanss musical personality feels at stake.
The Maple Leaf club went smoke-free voluntarily in 2014 as did another club where artists had been demanding smoke-free nights.
A lot of the performance venues were already starting to show that consideration to performers so I wish the city would have just let that happen instead of forcing the ban into every corner bar that doesnt host music, says Zalia BeVille, manager of the All Ways Lounge, which went smoke-free in 2013 because, she says, The horn players and the singers, they asked us for it.
Luckily, All Ways has an outdoor patio, unlike Lost Love Lounge, whose owner, Geoff Douville, loves the ban  hed previously felt forced to live with smoke to keep his bar  nancially viable.
Theres no way I could have banned smoking in my bar without it being a rule throughout the whole city, says Douville.
But, if I make that rule, they walk down the block to a bar with smoking.
Back home in Coventry, every pub where I was a regular closed within a year of the smoking ban, remembers Timms of the UKs ban, begun in 2007.
Lost Loves Douville, though, feels the ban to be a great business opportunity.
The number of people who would enjoy coming out to our bar, with our food, but would never come because they didnt want to smell like smoke for the next seven days  were now an option for all those people.
Nor does Douville worry about noise complaints like Walker does: No court is gonna label a bar a nuisance after the city has rati ed a smoking ban that requires you to go outside!
Councilwoman LaToya Cantrell, who introduced and pushed the ban, disagrees: The responsibility is on the bar-owner to keep their clientele respectful outside their establishment as well, she says.
I think its about communication and creating partnerships between the communities and the businesses.
The most vulnerable people who are working in smoky conditions, these citizens are the backbone of our hospitality industry, which drives the economy in the state of Louisiana.
Bar customers are encouraged to come  ll out a form or call 311 and to include date-and-time-stamped photographs documenting illegal smoking.
Unworried, Geoff Douville says that hes used to noise complaints by now so bring on the ban.
In the end, Douville shares Cantrells win-win optimism.
Of course theyre gonna complain, he accepts.
But it doesnt mean theyre gonna win. 
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recently gathered in Copenhagen to present its latest report on the impacts and pace of climate change.
Climate change is now measured on all continents and our efforts to lower emissions must be intensi ed to avoid it escalating out of control.
In the spirit of focusing on what can be done, Sustainia Award, chaired by Arnold Schwarzenegger, celebrated ten leading sustainability solutions deployed in 84 countries.
From Switzerland, we learned how we can recycle and reuse old clothes and shoes more effectively in a recycle system currently deployed in over 60 countries.
The ten projects presented each offered unique solutions to sustainability challenges but it was the Nigerian initiative, Wecyclers, that won Arnold Schwarzeneggers, and the rest of jurys, vote and took the Sustainia Award 2014.
By deploying a  eet of cargo bicycles to collect and recycle unmanaged waste in Lagos, Wecyclers lets families exchange garbage for consumer goods via an SMS-based point system.
Recycling companies purchase Wecyclers sorted waste for reprocessing into products  they turn it into mattresses, pillows and trash bags.
Wecyclers is a response to local waste issues, where its estimated that only 40% of the citys rubbish is collected.
According to the World Bank, only 46% of municipal solid waste in Africa is collected.
More than 5,000 households have signed up so far and there are plans to extend the initiative to other cities throughout Nigeria.
Sustainability is not solely a matter of bringing down emissions; it is also a question of using our natural resources more intelligently and creating healthier lives for ourselves.
With a wide range of solutions addressing the equally wide range of challenges, we must focus more on the important part of the story that creates enthusiasm and momentum, and spurs action for much-needed change. 
The tranquil chorus of the natural world is in danger of being lost to todays generation as people screen out the noises that surround them, a senior US researcher warns.
The problem was exacerbated by people listening to music through their earphones instead of tuning in to the birds and other sounds of nature that can easily be drowned out by traf c, music and other noises, he said.
This learned deafness is a real issue, Fristrup told the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in San Jose.
We are conditioning ourselves to ignore the information coming into our ears.
This gift that we are born with  to reach out and hear things hundreds of metres away, all these incredible sounds  is in danger of being lost through a generational amnesia, he said.
For the past ten years, the US National Park Service has recorded sound levels at more than 600 sites across the US, including Yosemite in California, Yellowstone and Denali in Alaska.
Its not surprising people are putting on earphones or even noise cancelling headphones to try and create a quieter or more congenial environment, he said.
People quickly become accustomed to changes in their environments, including rising noise levels, and, over time, Fristrup fears that we will accept far worse environmental conditions than we should and forget how much quieter the world could be.
The warning came as other scientists reported bene cial health effects from listening to natural sounds.
In one experiment, Taff told participants who visited his lab to give an impromptu talk that would be judged by researchers standing behind a one-way mirror.
Measurements of their heart rate and the stress hormone, cortisol, before and after the speech found that people calmed down faster when they listened to nature recordings than when the same audio tracks were interspersed with sounds from road traf c, aeroplanes and even normal conversation.
Why natural sounds might be calming to people is unclear but Fristrup speculates that, over millions of years of evolution, we may have come to associate the more tranquil sounds of the natural world with safety.
Valter Piscedda, the centre- left mayor of Elmas, a small town near Sardinias capital, Cagliari, wants to pay residents to leave.
The council will pay for ten unemployed locals to take intensive English lessons, board a cheap  ight and look for jobs elsewhere in Europe.
Over the past year and a half  especially in the past few months  I have been receiving young people, almost every day, who are despairing about their search for work.
So, my reasoning was this: put everything in place that the council administration can put in place so that those who want to gain experience abroad are able to, he said.
For the Adesso Parto (Now Im leaving) programme, Elmass council has allocated 12,000 on a  rst-come,  rst-served basis to applicants aged between 18 and 50.
The idea of encouraging people to up sticks is sensitive at a time when  oods of Italians  many of them bright young graduates  are leaving their country every year.
But Piscedda, who belongs to the Democratic Party of the Prime Minister, Matteo Renzi, denies he is facilitating a brain drain and believes that the people he is sending away may well return and give me back 100 times what they were given.
Its about allowing them the dignity of not having to ask a friend for money or place burdens on families that cannot do it, he said.
Earlier in 2014, he added, the council launched a scheme whereby businesses were given  nancial incentives to hire young workers from Elmas.
In Elmas, the scheme has provoked mixed reactions.
The son of a friend of mine who didnt study much has ended up in London and hes really  nding his way.
Piscedda, however, is undeterred, remarking of his online critics: Probably, they are people that arent in need ... Every day, I deal with peoples problems and I have to do something to try to solve them.

There are now an estimated 1,500 wolves in Poland.
It ate a red deer, says the University of Warsaw biologist.
DNA tests have established that Polish wolves are travellers.
asks student Alex Entwisle, 23, on a  eld trip to southern Poland from his college in the UK.
The animal science students have spent the day observing droppings and paw prints in the spruce-clad Beskidy mountains of the Polish Carpathians.
As the guest of a British charity, the Wolves and Humans Foundation, Mys_ajek toured the Scottish Highlands in 2015 and took questions from villagers about the Polish experience.
We track them using motion-activated cameras in the forest and by following their prints in the mud and snow.
All pack members care for the young with solidarity and devotion.
He is fascinated by these aloof canines who remained in the wild 33,000 years ago when others decided on a much more comfortable existence as domestic dogs.
Mys_ajek advises farmers on erecting electric fences.
In 1989, when the communists relinquished power, Poland had only one motorway.
Beginning in the 1950s, hunting wolves had been encouraged by the authorities.
The Environment Minister, Jan Szyszko, makes no secret of being a hunter.
It would be amazing for the environment to have them back because of the problem of too many deer.
Organic food has more of the antioxidant compounds linked to better health than regular food, and lower levels of toxic metals and pesticides, according to the most comprehensive scienti c analysis to date.
