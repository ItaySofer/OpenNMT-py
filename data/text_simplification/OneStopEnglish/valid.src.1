Away from their phones, 12- to 15-year-olds have a very different relationship with other media, too.
They spend 20% of their time viewing short video clips, for example on YouTube, or news clips distributed via Facebook and other social sites.
The rest of their viewing is shared between DVDs, streamed content through Net ix or iTunes and recorded television programmes.
From 2006 to 2008, Duran took out 68 commercial and personal loans from 39 banks in Spain.
He spent two months in prison before being bailed for 50,000.
More than 25,000 kilos of dead  sh were collected in the aftermath and nearly 2,000 adult birds, chicks, eggs and nests were killed or destroyed.
It was Spains worst environmental disaster and the clean-up cost 90m.
"There are riches here, riches that are badly needed by local inhabitants, said Vicente Fernandez Guerrero, secretary-general of Innovation, Industry and Energy for Andalucia.
People have been digging metals and ores here since Roman times, after all.
The best technology in the world will be used here, Fernandez insisted.
For his part, Carlos Davila, who works for the Spanish Ornithological Society in Donana, was also alarmed at the proposal.
This is a very, very bad idea indeed, he told me.
The trouble is that Spain does not have the public resources it possessed 16 years ago.
After the disaster, Spain woke up to the fact that it possessed a place of real ecological importance and did a lot to clean it up and protect it, he added.
It shows the power of Star Wars that, although they were disappointing, the prequels still managed to make a lot of money, said Rosser.
We may not yet be living in an age of  ying cars, as predicted in the 1985  lm Back to the Future II, but the rise of smartphones and other new technologies is creating a reality that is arguably as exciting and almost as far-fetched.
Communication between riders and drivers, between different vehicles and between cars and infrastructure is bringing transportation into a new era, according to Allan Clelland, an expert on transportation technology.
According to the study, those born in the 1990s are making 4% fewer car trips and travelling 18% fewer miles per year, on average, than members of previous generations did at the same stage in their lives.
Companies are working to develop technology that will enable a vehicle to tell traf c control systems not only that it is present but also where it is going and how fast it is travelling.
Automation Driverless cars have been in the headlines ever since Google began road testing the vehicles back in 2012 but no-one really knows when driverless cars will become commonplace.
To see what driverless cars might look like in action, go to the video at: vimeo.com/37751380.
The Mesolithic man, who lived in Spain around 7,000 years ago, had an unusual mix of blue eyes, black or brown hair and dark skin, according to analyses of his genetic make-up.
The Spanish team started their work after a group of cavers stumbled upon two skeletons in a deep and complex cave system high up in the Cantabrian Mountains of northwest Spain in 2006.
This guy had to be darker than any modern European, but we dont know how dark, the scientist said.
You see a lot of reconstructions of these people hunting and gathering and they look like modern Europeans with light skin.
You never see a reconstruction of a Mesolithic hunter-gatherer with dark skin and blue eye colour, Lalueza-Fox said.
The Spanish team went on to compare the genome of the hunter-gatherer to those of modern Europeans from different regions to see how they might be related.
But, in 2013, one of the mothers, who is 33 and unemployed, sued her ex-partner for maintenance for her daughter.
A DNA test was done and it was found it was not his baby and not her baby.
Its four years later: you can understand she doesnt want to give up her baby.
But, whatever happens, someone wont be happy.
Karabo Ngidi, a lawyer with the centre, said Whats going to happen must be in the best interests of the children.
In 1995, two mothers were awarded damages after their sons, born in 1989, were accidentally switched at the Johannesburg hospital where they were born.
Tourist numbers are down 80% this year, said Mayor Maria Kakali, in an of ce in the village where she grew up, home to around 200 people.
If we have to pay a tax of 23%, Im sorry to say it but we will all die on the island, says Kakali.
It has just over 3,000 beds for visitors, compared with tens of thousands on an island such as Rhodes.
The truth is the government doesnt pay much attention to the islands of the north Aegean, she said, so I would take all the kids from our school to the gates of parliament, to tell them: There is still life in these islands. 
The age of the big British summer music festival, including Glastonbury, is drawing to a close, according to the leading rock promoter and manager Harvey Goldsmith.
That is a big, big problem in our industry.
And, we are not producing a new generation of these kind of acts  the likes of the Rolling Stones, Muse, even the Arctic Monkeys  that can headline.
There were about 900 music festival events in the UK between May and September 2014, he said, and there is no way they can all continue.
He didnt want to risk leaving the US  it was him, not Elvis, said Goldsmith.
Freddie Mercury had to be our most powerful stage performer, the best live performer weve ever had.
Were not producing a new generation of this kind of act.
Coldplay is probably the last one to come up and that was ten years ago.
So, with no big acts to headline, there are no big shows.
What is it like to look at the very last of something?
If he does not mate successfully soon with one of two female northern white rhinos at Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya, there will be no more of their kind, male or female, born anywhere.
Apart from these three animals, there are only two other northern white rhinos in the world, both in zoos, both female.
His eye is a sad black dot in his massive wrinkled face as he wanders the reserve with his guards.
It is a majestic rectangle of strong bone and leathery  esh, a head that expresses pure strength.
Human beings  we always kill the things we love.
But the same people who painted such sensitive portraits of Ice Age rhinos helped to kill them off.
The northern white rhino is the rarest species of African rhino.
There are far greater numbers of southern white rhinos and black rhinos.
From 2007, when just 13 rhinos were killed by poachers in South Africa, the killings have grown horri cally.
In 2014, 1,215 rhinos were slaughtered for their horns in South Africa.
In 2006, the Irish designer completed a scuba-diving course and loved the feeling of being able to breathe underwater and observe  sh in their natural environment.
Although it allows you to stay underwater for longer, you have to plan your whole day around it.
You have 20kg to 50kg of gear with you  you cant be walking on the beach and decide you want to go in.
It was during a  nal-year project for his product design degree at the University of Limerick that Redmond produced the Express Dive.
The device can take in enough air for two minutes of diving and takes approximately the same amount of time to be re lled.
Redmond says the mouthpiece feels similar to using a snorkel.
The typical swimmer can hold their breath for about 40 seconds while underwater, he says.
A lot of my job is listening to peoples lives all day, every day and it started to feel so overwhelming to go on social media and see every single detail of everybodys life, including people that I dont really have a relationship with, she said.
One thing I really liked about Facebook was that I could sit for hours and click on a friend and then click on one of their friends and one of their friends and one of their friends and literally end up on someones Facebook page from the other side of the world, she said.
I wonder what it would be like if I didnt spend these seconds here and spent them doing something else.
He spends his lift rides and spare moments at work reading news articles and books rather than scrolling through a newsfeed.
And with no friends accounts to follow online, he has to pick up the phone and call them, something hes come to de nitely enjoy.
Lauren Raskauskas, 22, Naples, Florida Raskauskas describes herself as a pretty private person.
She recently deleted her Twitter account and deactivated her Facebook account two years ago after realizing she didnt like everyone knowing what I was doing.
He claims that he hasnt seen any effect at this point.
Even though classmates post about parties and events on Facebook, they make sure to send him a text message, too, he said.
His billing, The Beale Street Blues Boy, was shortened to Blues Boy King and thence to BB.
But he would also cite the earlier blues guitarists Blind Lemon Jefferson and Lonnie Johnson and the jazz players Charlie Christian and Django Reinhardt.
He once explained that his guitar technique was partly based on his lack of skill: I started to bend notes because I could never play in the bottleneck style, like Elmore James and Booker White.
About a year and a half ago, he said in 1969, all of a sudden, kids started coming up to me saying, Youre the greatest blues guitarist in the world.
Smokers are the key group for e-cigarette  rms because seven out of ten vapers are smokers.
Numbers who use e-cigarettes while continuing to smoke are going down, West said.
Weve only been tracking vaping for just over a year, so its a short time period, but we are not seeing growth in the number of long-term ex-smokers or never smokers using e-cigarettes.
Our customers are still very happy with the product, and technology and innovation in hardware is improving user experience and helping them to switch from traditional cigarettes.
They are more popular than nicotine patches and may or may not be more effective.
There is a tendency among some local authorities and organizations to treat e-cigarettes as cigarettes and ban them in public places and outdoors, he said.
Vienna is the worlds best city to live in, Baghdad is the worst and London, Paris and New York do not even make it into the top 35, according to international research into quality of life.
German-speaking cities dominate the rankings in the 18th Mercer Quality of Life study, with Vienna joined by Zurich, Munich, Dusseldorf and Frankfurt in the top seven.
You dont realize how safe Vienna is until you head abroad, said Hartlauer.
We also have terri c public transport, with the underground working 24 hours at weekends, and it only costs 1 per trip.
The fall of the Berlin Wall helped de ne Vienna as the hub for companies wanting to do business in Central Europe.
Zurich in Switzerland is named by Mercer as having the worlds second highest quality of life but the Viennese say their city is far more fun.
We asked waiters around the UK what they think of the tipping process (including how much they take home from tips and whether its fair) and what would improve it for them.
Rodri, 37, London: Around 50% of a waiters income is tips Average tips: 60 per eight-hour shift I think they treat waiters best in ... the US  Everything has got fairer since the tipping scandal was exposed in the summer of 2015.
However, you still hear horror stories from new employees at some chains.
I can average around 60 in tips per shift but, on a good night, this goes up to over 100 and, on a poor night, its around 40.
Elle, 22, Edinburgh: We never know whether its fair Average tips: 20 per eight-hour shift I think they treat waiters best in ... France  I work three jobs, all on part-time zero-hours contracts, in catering and hospitality.
In restaurants, because a lot of customers add tips through card payments, the staff never actually see how much is getting tipped  so we dont know whether were getting our fair share or not.
Its really unfair that tips go towards breakages made by customers.
The managers should have ways to pay for broken glasses and plates without docking our tips.
I make around 20 a shift but would only be given 10-15 of that money.
I really rely on tips because I am only paid 7 an hour.
Tom, Manchester: A big night of tips can help pay the rent Average tips: 40 per eight-hour shift I think they treat waiters best in ... Italy  Where I used to work,  oor staff kept 80% of cash tips and 40% of card tips.
Its hard to say how much I earned a shift; maybe around 40, 20 from card tips.
They have got tipping right in Italy, where people dont add a service charge but usually round up their bill so, if they get a meal for 19, they leave a 20 note and dont ask for change.
A more open and connected world is a better world.
You wont be surprised by an ex in the street with a new girlfriend or boyfriend: you already know theyre dating someone else from the romantic sel es.
It doesnt necessarily mean we see them the same way.
Professor Robin Dunbar is famous for his research that suggests a person can only have roughly 150 people as a social group.
An overwhelming majority of 91% post a photo of themselves, 71% post the city or town where they live, up from 61%, more than half give email addresses and a  fth give their phone number.
The data and analytics available to you are extraordinary.
4 Facebook has been the tool to organize revolutions Though the Arab Spring was dubbed the Twitter revolution, organizing demonstrations and direct action has been revolutionized by Facebook.
5 Facebook makes news, breaks news and decides what is news Roughly 71% of 18- to 24-year-olds say the internet is their main news source and 63% of users overall, according to the Pew Research Center.
And 39% are connected to people they have never met in person.
We may as well get used to it, said David Kirkpatrick, author of The Facebook Effect.
If the amount of food wasted around the world were reduced by just 25%, there would be enough food to feed all the people who are malnourished, according to the UN.
Each year, 1.3bn tonnes of food, about a third of all that is produced, is wasted, including about 45% of all fruit and vegetables, 35% of  sh and seafood, 30% of cereals, 20% of dairy products and 20% of meat.
In the developing world, food waste is virtually non-existent, says Robert van Otterdijk, coordinator of the UN Food and Agriculture Organizations Save Food programme.
Food waste is happening in countries where people can afford to throw away food.
The foods most commonly found in British bins are bread, vegetables, fruit and milk.
By percentage, the most wasted food is lettuce and leafy salads, of which consumers throw away 38% (64,000 tonnes) of all they buy.
Cockrell, a former Wall Street worker turned therapist, spends large parts of his days walking through Central Park or the Battery Park in downtown Manhattan near Wall Street, as a con dant and counsellor to some of New Yorks wealthiest people.
Many of the extremely wealthy  the 1% of the 1%  feel that their problems are really not problems.
There is the feeling that they have to hide the fact that they are rich.
And, then, there is the isolation  being in the 1%, it turns out, can be lonely.
The media, she said, is partly to blame for making the rich feel like they need to hide or feel ashamed.
Since the 2008  nancial crisis, the income gap has expanded and the situation has gotten worse for the wealthy, Cockrell said.
Never being able to trust your friendships with people of different means, I think that is dif cult, said Cockrell.
Some Americans have taken to keeping their wealth secret.
There are a lot of people that are hiding their wealth because they are concerned about negative judgment, said Traeger-Muney.
If you are part of the 1%, you still have problems and they are legitimate to you.
Money is not the only thing that de nes you, he said.
Is this the moment when streaming goes truly mainstream?
Apple is good at mainstreaming products but its not that good.
Apple, and the record industry, cannot afford to get rid of the download market just yet  so streaming and downloading will have to coexist under the Apple brand, one representing the future as the other gets progressively slower and sicker.
A century ago, Venice  one of the most beautiful and low-lying cities in the world  used to  ood around ten times a year.
I manage one minute and 12 seconds.
At a pool in Bristol, she taught me some simple exercises to help me hold my breath for longer while swimming underwater.
I asked how she did it: very slow breathing for several minutes prior to each dive, then a big, deep breath before diving in.
At least, it doesnt if youre breath-holding on land.
When you breathe in, youre contracting the muscle of your diaphragm, pulling it  at so that the volume of your chest increases  and air is drawn into your lungs.
Steve Deace, a prominent Iowa conservative, said that Trumps antics are both a good and a bad thing.
As the pollster notes: Trump says what theyre thinking and, the more outrageous he is, the more they agree with him.
Sometimes life just isnt fair.
In fact, he earned just 10 from the patent and has not made a penny more from it since.
The website ATMInventor.com concludes: Who invented the idea of an ATM?
In the section about great British inventions of the twentieth century, it states: In the 1960s, James Goodfellow (1937-) invented the cash-dispensing automatic teller machine (ATM) or cashpoint.
So after all these years, Goodfellow  nally  nds himself being talked about in the same breath as John Logie Baird (the television), Alan Turing (the Turing machine), Sir Frank Whittle (the jet engine) and Sir Tim Berners-Lee (the World Wide Web).
British people think the top 1% wealthiest households own 59% of their countrys wealth, when they actually only own 23%.
Americans think that 33% of their population are immigrants, when in fact it is only 14%.
In Britain, people think that an extraordinary 43% of young adults aged 25-34 still live at home with their parents, rather than the actual 14%.
The worst case is Saudi Arabia, where people think only 28% are, when 71% are.
Britons think it is 44%, when it is actually nearly half as much again  62% are either overweight or obese.
And, in many ways, it is not our misperceptions but these realities across different countries that are the most interesting and important aspects of the study.
Thats 65 litres of clean, drinkable water that were infusing with soap and washing down the drain each and every day  sometimes more than once.
The vital importance of clean water is becoming harder and harder to ignore, as California enters another summer of drought.
Skip a few showers, put down the soap and let those lovely little bacteria  ourish a little, would you? 
The conventional school starting time works for 10-year-olds but not 16- to 18-year-olds.
For the older teenagers, it might be more sensible to start the school day at 11am or even later.
Kelley says the working day should be more forgiving of our natural rhythms.
Describing the average sleep loss per night for different age groups, he says: Between 14 and 24, its more than two hours.
For people aged between 24 and about 30 or 35, its about an hour and a half.
Kelley says that synchronized hours could have many positive consequences.
The positive side of this is peoples performance, mood and health will improve.
Its very uplifting in a way because its a solution that will make people less ill, and happier and better at what they do.
A later start to the day for many, says Kelley, is something that would bene t everyone, particularly families.
And, yes, he says he  nds the start of his working day much easier now than he did when he was younger. 
Maybe GPS signals are blocked or partially blocked, in which case its going to have an incorrect idea about where it is.
One major problem is maintaining radio contact with a drone and planning for what happens if that contact breaks.
If you have a vehicle that can go into a neighbourhood, it can deliver from that base.
You need a 15-minute distance and typical off-the-shelf drones have about that distance.
The Reaper drone has one failure in 10,000 hours, Singh said.
Part of this is simply that air travel is inherently dangerous and, thus, standards are much higher.
Lots of her friends cant pay for heating or medication and many would go hungry if it were not for the East Hampton Food Pantry, she says, which is just one of several food pantries in the town.
Vicki Littman, chairperson of the East Hampton Food Pantry, which provided more than 31,000 food parcels in 2015, says the number of people seeking out the food pantry is ever increasing.
Housing is, by far, the biggest cost in the Hamptons.
Theres certainly a lot of wealth here but almost all of that wealth is in second homes only used in the summer, says Cantwell, the son of a  sherman father and a house-cleaner mother.
But, the rest of us live here year round.
There are famous and very wealthy people but then you have hard-working and poor people struggling to get by.
Youve got to remember that this community was founded as a farming and  shing community of people who lived off the land and the water  a real working-class community.
I want to work but theres no work to be done.
Some danced, some posed for photos, some drank, but mostly they just walked and talked football, waiting for the next game to begin on the nearby FanFest big screen.
The trip has not been problem free.
His son, Andrew, had his sunglasses stolen almost as soon as he sat on the beach.
And, they have been surprised that many bars are not set up with big screens for the games.
But, like many fans, they said they loved the atmosphere, if not the logistics, of this tournament which has got off to a spectacular start on the pitch.
Elsewhere, there has been a glut of goals: 28 in the  rst eight games  almost three times as many as at the same stage in South Africa in 2010.
The Globo newspaper listed a number of shortcomings in the 12 host cities.
The worst transport problems were in Natal, where bus drivers have been on strike since 12 June.
But, protests have diminished since the opening day, when small demonstrations took place in several cities, prompting police to use tear gas and pepper spray.
Since then, the only security threat has been petty theft and overexcited fans.
But, these days, the golden arches of McDonalds are looking a little tarnished.
Almost 60 years after Ray Kroc opened his  rst restaurant in Des Plaines, Illinois, consumers are losing their appetite for a Big Mac and fries.
The number of 19-to-21-year-olds visiting McDonalds once a month has fallen by 13% since 2011, according to food analysts Technomic, while the number of 22-to-37-year- olds visiting has not grown.
To add to the companys problems, McDonalds hamburgers were recently named the worst in America in a poll of more than 32,000 American  diners, who said they would rather eat a burger at Five Guys, Smashburger or Fuddruckers.
Have you ever used pink slime in your burgers?
Ever since it introduced $2 items on its dollar menu, it has gained a reputation for being more expensive than its rivals, while many consumers complain that service is slower.
Prices have indeed gone up but they havent gone up as quickly as the rest of the fast-service chains in the US.
McDonalds has a bigger menu than some, with more complicated items  its chicken McWrap takes 60 seconds to make.
Only four out of McDonalds 14,000 US restaurants had so far tested build your own burger, he said, raising questions about how it could be scaled up.
Faehrmann said the protests had shown Australians wanted sharks protected: Whats amazing is so many people in Australia love sharks.
Anthony Joyce, a surfer who once had his foot caught in a sharks mouth, said: The number of sharks they are going to kill is going to make no difference in the scheme of things.
Conservationists argue there is no evidence the cull will reduce the number of shark attacks on humans, as no previous cull has solely used drumlines.
Researchers at the University of Western Australia say the recent spate of shark attacks in the state may have more to do with the state having the fastest-growing population in Australia, rather than a rising number of sharks.
The activity in Western Australia is compounding the human tragedy of shark attacks.
Youre advertising a problem that doesnt exist in a major way and youre deterring people from wanting to come to Perth and your beautiful countryside around it.
All youre going to achieve, I think, is to worry people unnecessarily. 
Race engineer A race engineer liaises between the driver and the mechanics.
What the job involves: A race engineer acts as the interpreter between the race-car mechanics and the driver, says race engineer Jamie Muir.
Quali cations: A university degree, typically in automotive/mechanical engineering or motorsport technology.
To succeed as a race engineer, you need ... to be able to deal with pressure.

Typically, pilots must  y beside the power line, sometimes as little as 20 feet away and just 30 feet off the ground.
Retailer Sports Direct recently became the focus of controversy on zero-hours when it emerged that the company employs around 20,000 of its 23,000 staff on the contracts.
The retailers use of the contracts was followed by details of a string of other companies using the deals, including cinema chain Cineworld and Buckingham Palace, which uses them for its 350 summer workers.
Pub group J D Wetherspoon has 24,000 of its staff  80% of its workforce  on the terms.
Dave Prentis, of the trade union Unison, said: The vast majority of workers are only on these contracts because they have no choice.
The charity National Trust, which employs many of its seasonal workers on zero-hours contracts, said it offered the same pay and bene ts to those workers, pro rata, as full-time staff, but needed some workers to be on a more  exible arrangement.
Our properties have told us its important to be able to reorganize staff rotas quickly to respond to the weather and zero-hours contracts allow us to do this.
While some employees welcome the  exibility of such contracts, for many, zero-hours contracts leave them insecure and unsure of when work will come, he said.
The institutes  gures also suggest that 17% of employers in the private sector made use of zero- hours contracts, considerably lower than the 34% of organizations in the voluntary sector and 24% in the public sector.
Industries where employers were most likely to report at least one person on a zero-hours contract were hotels, catering and leisure (48%), education (35%) and healthcare (27%). 
He gets what all referees hope for every time they referee a match.
A few weeks earlier, Riley, Dunn and another former referee, Peter Jones, made their way to another level-5 match to monitor another referee tipped to progress  John Brooks.
A little later, the football club secretary arrived with envelopes to pay the officials for their time  the match fee at level 5 is 95 so it is safe to assume these men do not do it for the cash.
How does he feel watching football on TV when a referee gets vilified?
Riley, as a young referee, went out and bought himself books on psychology and nutrition as there was no information on offer to him at all.
Riley, as a young referee, went out and bought himself books on psychology and nutrition as there was no information on offer to him at all.
He also has the support of a sports psychologist, Liam Slack, for regular guidance and an exercise regime to help him handle the 11km he runs during a game.
We are all in favour of anything that makes the referees job better and makes them more effective on the field of play, says Riley.
Buildings warm up in a number of different ways.
The Stanford mirror was designed in such a way that it re ects 97% of the visible light that falls on it.
When the mirror is warmed up, it releases heat at a speci c wavelength of infrared light that passes easily through the atmosphere and out into space.
You could use this on buildings so you have to spend much less on air conditioning or maybe you wouldnt need it at all.
You could put it on top of shopping malls.
The project is a key plank in Moroccos ambitions to use its untapped deserts to become a global solar superpower.
When they are  nished, the four plants at Ouarzazate will occupy a space as big as Moroccos capital city, Rabat, and generate 580 mega-watts (MW) of electricity, enough to power a million homes.
Solar energy will make up a third of Moroccos renewable energy supply by 2020, with wind and hydro taking the same share each.
Whether that ambition is achieved remains to be seen but exporting solar energy could have stabilizing effects within and between countries, according to the Moroccan solar energy agency (Masen).
We believe that its possible to export energy to Europe but,  rst, we would have to build the interconnectors which dont yet exist, said Maha el-Kadiri, a Masen spokeswoman.
In a three-year period, the number of paying subscribers rose from 8 million to 28 million, according to the 2014 digital music report from the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI).
Easily accessible from smartphones and tablets, subscription services are popular with people looking to try out new music without committing to buying a download or a CD.
Retailers are becoming increasingly aware that shoppers who are prepared to set foot in a physical store want a service and an experience they cant get online, says Simon Boydell, spokesman for Marketforce, which has more than 300,000 mystery shoppers on its books.
Our clients want to measure how well their stores are delivering on that experience.
Each day, they typically spend up to eight hours visiting  ve to ten stores, plus another hour or two  ling detailed reports on every aspect of their visit.
Shoppers are usually repaid any money they spend in the stores and may also be allowed to keep the products they buy.
Im always given a scenario, such as buying something from a speci c department or a new product range, but, within that framework, I can often buy whatever I want  and keep it.
Her income is typically 30,000 to 40,000 a year and that doesnt include all the freebies she gets on the job.
She does, however,  nd it satisfying to return to a store she has previously mystery shopped and see standards have improved.
Marketforce shoppers typically get a couple of pounds for a visit as a token gesture for their time and effort, says Boydell.
I wont touch those jobs anymore.
Hannah, a 41-year-old City lawyer, has conducted nearly 500 visits for the Mystery Dining Company in her spare time without receiving remuneration or travel expenses.
When the Russian capsule opened on to the cool air of Kazakhstan, Kelly said, he smelled a fragrance like a plant was blooming in that area.
He said the message we need to save the planet slightly missed the point: The planet will get better; its us that wont be here because well destroy the environment.
A single brain spot is associated with a number of related words.
And, each single word lights up many different brain spots.
It is possible that this approach could be used to decode information about what words a person is hearing, reading or possibly even thinking, said Alexander Huth, the  rst author on the study.
Per person, that amounted to hearing roughly 25,000 words  and more than 3,000 different words  as they lay in the scanner.
The atlas shows how words and related terms exercise the same regions of the brain.
The same region responds to killed, convicted, murdered and confessed.
On the brains right-hand side, near the top of the head, is one of the brain spots activated by family terms: wife, husband, children, parents.
Each word is represented by more than one spot because words tend to have several meanings.
One part of the brain, for example, reliably responds to the word top, along with other words that describe clothing.
One of them responds to numbers and measurements, another to buildings and places.
The scientists only scanned  ve men and two women, however.
It is highly possible that people from different backgrounds and cultures will have different semantic brain atlases.
Forcing people outside the bar to smoke is going to exacerbate the tension thats already there.
Martha Wood lives beside a loud bar that hosts live music.
Theres no way I could have banned smoking in my bar without it being a rule throughout the whole city, says Douville.
Smoker Neil Timms owns an English pub and met the smoking ban before, in England.
To avoid the same fate, hes spending money to build a patio.
Lost Loves Douville, though, feels the ban to be a great business opportunity.
The number of people who would enjoy coming out to our bar, with our food, but would never come because they didnt want to smell like smoke for the next seven days  were now an option for all those people.
Councilwoman LaToya Cantrell, who introduced and pushed the ban, disagrees: The responsibility is on the bar-owner to keep their clientele respectful outside their establishment as well, she says.
The owners and bartenders need to tell them to go have a smoke but be respectful to their communities.
I think its about communication and creating partnerships between the communities and the businesses.
Bar customers are encouraged to come  ll out a form or call 311 and to include date-and-time-stamped photographs documenting illegal smoking.
Unworried, Geoff Douville says that hes used to noise complaints by now so bring on the ban.
But it doesnt mean theyre gonna win. 
This learned deafness is a real issue, Fristrup told the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in San Jose.
We are conditioning ourselves to ignore the information coming into our ears.
This gift that we are born with  to reach out and hear things hundreds of metres away, all these incredible sounds  is in danger of being lost through a generational amnesia, he said.
For the past ten years, the US National Park Service has recorded sound levels at more than 600 sites across the US, including Yosemite in California, Yellowstone and Denali in Alaska.
If  nding peace and quiet becomes dif cult enough, many, many children will grow up without the experience and I think its a very real problem, he said.
Speaking at the same meeting, Derrick Taff, a social scientist at Pennsylvania State University, described preliminary experiments which suggest that listening to recordings from national parks, of waterfalls, birdsong and wind, helped people recover from stressful events.
Valter Piscedda, the centre- left mayor of Elmas, a small town near Sardinias capital, Cagliari, wants to pay residents to leave.
This is, above all, an idea born of common sense and experience, he told the Guardian.
And they want to go and gain work experience abroad; life experience, too.
In Elmas, the scheme has provoked mixed reactions.
The reality is that there is little work here, said Alessandro Macis.
said Consuelo Melis, who works behind the bar in a local cafe.
The work I can create, as mayor, is temporary.
Robert Mys_ajek stops dead.
There are now an estimated 1,500 wolves in Poland.
Wolves are  along with the brown bear, the lynx and the wolverine  Europes last large predator carnivores.
DNA tests have established that Polish wolves are travellers.
Mys_ajek says only scienti c arguments  the need to regenerate forests and control the wild animal population  can save Europes wild carnivores, especially the unpopular wolf.
In 1989, when the communists relinquished power, Poland had only one motorway.
The Environment Minister, Jan Szyszko, makes no secret of being a hunter.
It is not as if you can argue to the politicians that wolves are a big tourist attraction.
Tom Sanders, a professor of nutrition at Kings College London, said the research did show some differences.
The results of the research are based on an analysis of 343 peer-reviewed studies from around the world  more than ever before  which examine differences between organic and conventional fruit, vegetables and cereals.
Leifert and his colleagues conclude that many antioxidants have previously been linked to a reduced risk of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases and certain cancers.
The researchers found much higher levels of cadmium, a toxic metal, in conventional crops.
A further criticism is that the differences seen may result from different climates, soil types and crop varieties, and not from organic farming, though the researchers argue that combining many studies should average out these other differences.
Browning said: This research backs up what people think about organic food.
In other countries, there have long been much higher levels of support and acceptance of the bene ts of organic food and farming.
The canoe is our island, the crew members are the community and the navigator is the leader, Pittman says.
On a canoe, you are not just going from one destination to another using the stars, the moon, the sun and the birds.
The of cial title of the expedition is the Mua Voyage and it is a partnership between the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Oceania Regional Of ce and  ve Paci c Island countries: Samoa, Tonga, New Zealand, the Cook Islands and Fiji.
The main goal of the 6,000-nautical-mile (11,000km) trip was to deliver a special message to the World Parks Congress.
According to the IUCN, as of 2013, the amount of the worlds oceans in marine protected areas was not even three per cent and less than one per cent of that is no take.
And the effects of climate change were already beginning to impact seriously on Paci c Islanders.
I work hard and am good at my job but, when PizzaExpress thinks it can get away with taking a percentage of our hard-earned tips left on a card, I get upset.
PizzaExpress joins restaurant chains Ask and Zizzi in siphoning off 8% of the tips paid by card but other chains deduct even more.
Cafe_ Rouge, Bella Italia and Belgo deduct 10%, as do Strada and Giraffe, which is owned by Tesco.
Almost 6,000 people have so far signed Unites online petition.
One waiter, who doesnt work for PizzaExpress but has worked for 11 years for another restaurant chain, said that at least a third of his income is from tips.
The way clouds affect global warming has been the biggest mystery surrounding future climate change.
4C would likely be catastrophic rather than simply dangerous, Sherwood said.
For example, it would make life difficult, if not impossible, in much of the tropics and would guarantee the eventual melting of the Greenland ice sheet and some of the Antarctic ice sheet, with sea levels rising by many metres as a result.
When water evaporates from the oceans, the vapour can rise over nine miles to form rain clouds that reflect sunlight; or, it may rise just a few miles and drift back down without forming clouds.
Climate sceptics like to criticize climate models for getting things wrong and we are the first to admit they are not perfect, said Sherwood.
But what we are finding is that the mistakes are being made by the models which predict less warming, not those that predict more.
Even in successful countries such as Indonesia and Vietnam, the proportion has been 20%.
Amin, 61, from rural Bangladesh, has seen his livelihood gradually decline, due to his own and his wifes illnesses, the cost of his sons marriage, the death of his father and loss of goods such as  shing nets.
Lovemore, 74, from Zimbabwe, has become one of the poorest people in his village.
He recently lost his job as a car-park attendant due to ill health and had to take in his  ve grandchildren after the death of his daughters.
The second is education, from early childhood to the start of work, to enable people to escape and stay out of poverty.
Even Nigeria, with its oil wealth, spends only $650 per capita, Shepherd said.
We Can Do It is not a female beer but a beer brewed by women that anyone can drink, she says.
One weekend they concocted the recipe and the next they brewed 1,600 litres.
This is not a beer that is aimed at women  its our hoppiest brew, says Thomas Bingebo, the head brewer at Ocean.
FemAle has already been approached by other breweries asking if they can brew new beers with them.
From all across Rwanda, and even parts of neighbouring Burundi, people  ock to the southern town of Butare to a little shop called Inzozi Nziza (Sweet Dreams).
Here, at the central African countrys  rst ice- cream parlour, customers can buy scoops in sweet cream, passion fruit, strawberry and pineapple  avours.
Ice cream is important, she says between mouthfuls of a honey- avoured offering.
True to Inzozi Nzizas motto, the shop can certainly make dreams come true.
Its something uniting people here, Kalisa Migendo, a 24-year-old agriculture student, says.
Inzozi Nziza was opened by the theatre director Odile Gakire Katese.
The musicians are Hutu and Tutsi women, some survivors of the 1994 genocide, during which almost a million Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed.
When Im drumming with them, it gives me power because were still alive and survivors.
Schools should teach navigation and map reading as life skills, he wrote.
What we did was to look at a set of current London taxi drivers and a set of London taxi drivers that had been retired for about four years, said neuroscientist Dr Hugo Spiers, head of the Spatial Cognition Group at University College London, who is an author of the study.
The way in which navigational technology is used could also affect its impact on our own abilities, says Spiers.
Ultimately, McKinlay believes, its essential that humans remain able to take control of their navigation.
La Premiere chose quon regarde (The First Thing We Look At) by Gregoire Delacourt tells the story of a French model who looks so similar to the American actor that the books lead male character thinks it is Johansson herself.
In the novel, the models looks mean that men see her only as a sex object, while women are jealous of her.
She has a series of adventures as Johansson until she is eventually found out and, in the end, dies in a car crash.
Delacourt has become one of Frances best-loved authors; his previous novel, My List of Desires, was translated into 47 languages and is now being adapted into a  lm.
I wrote a real love story and a homage to feminine beauty, especially interior beauty.
I thought she might send me  owers as it was a declaration of love for her, but she didnt understand, Delacourt said.
All were tested between 2007 and 2010 on three different measures of  tness: stamina, handgrip strength and lower-body power.
The results revealed that a childs month of birth could make signi cant differences to their levels of cardiovascular  tness, muscle strength and ability to accelerate, all of which predict how good someone is at sport, in which such attributes are vital.
Those born in October were almost as  t, scoring highest for strength and coming third for power, with December children close behind.
The gap in physical prowess between children in the same class but born in different months was sometimes very wide.
This is, potentially, a huge physical advantage, said Sandercock.
Such gaps could ultimately decide who became a top-level athlete because, as the paper says, selection into elite sports may often depend on very small margins or differences in an individuals physical performance.
The  ndings seem to show that children born in the early months of the school year enjoy a double autumn advantage  they are already known to have an academic advantage and, now, they also appear to be better equipped for sport, too.
Children that get a high-quality  rst experience, which develops their physical literacy, are those that will have greater agility, balance and coordination, and are more likely to develop an enjoyment of physical activity and excel in sport as they grow up, he said.
As soon as the children at one primary school in Stirling hear the words daily mile, they down their pencils and head out of the classroom to start running laps around the school  eld.
For three-and-a-half years, all pupils at St Ninians Primary have walked or run a mile each day.
The thought of children across the country running every day because of something weve done is phenomenal.
In Stirling alone, 30 schools have already started or are to start the daily mile.
The most important thing is that the children really enjoy it; otherwise, you couldnt sustain it.
At St Ninians, teachers take their pupils out of lessons on to a specially built circuit around the schools playing  eld for their daily mile whenever it best suits that days timetable.
The extent of the bene ts have yet to be determined but researchers from Stirling University have launched a comparative study to look for quantitative evidence of the physical, cognitive and emotional bene ts of the daily mile.
Paralympian, Tanni Grey-Thompson, chair of ukactive, the UKs leading not-for-pro t health body for physical activity, said: All children need to achieve 60 active minutes every day, whether in a lesson, on the walk to school or in the playground.
We know sitting still kills; not sitting still helps children build skills that will stay with them for life.
The Scottish government is also supportive.
In what Mason called the  rst city-scale genetic pro le ever, his team found meningitis at Times Square, a trace of anthrax on the handhold of a train carriage and bacteria that cause bubonic plague on a rubbish bin and ticket machine at stations in uptown Manhattan.
All around the subway, bacteria associated with cheeses  brie, cheddar, parmesan and the mozzarella of ubiquitous New York pizza  turned up.
The distinctive bacteria of Swiss cheese were more localized to midtown Manhattan and the  nancial district, and the bacteria used to ferment cabbage for kimchi and sauerkraut showed up in the  nancial district and Bay Ridge.
Species that cause diarrhoea and nausea, both benign and bad E.coli (mostly benign), and the bacteria that can cause skin infections and urinary-tract infections were common all over the city.
He said he hoped the research would provide a baseline of research for health of cials and geneticists, and could help health of cials to be better prepared to prevent and track diseases and pathogens. 
The yes campaign scored four big successes, winning 53% of the vote in Scotlands largest city, Glasgow, 57% in Dundee and 51% in North Lanarkshire.
We have heard the voice of Scotland and, now, the millions of voices of England must be heard, he said.
Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, said the referendum was a vote from the Scottish people for change.
We know our country needs to change in the way it is governed and we know our country needs to change in who it is governed for.
Theyve been left out of all of this for the last 18 years.
We will continue to  ght with the facts because the facts are on our side, he said recently on a conference call with journalists and analysts.
Already in the pipeline are plans for a new shark exhibition in Orlando and an attraction in San Antonio that will allow customers to swim with dolphins in a naturalistic setting.
SeaWorlds shares, which were worth $39 in 2013, were changing hands for just under $18 in August 2015. 
Stratford remained hugely important throughout Shakespeares life, argues Paul Edmondson, the head of learning and research at the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust.
But Stratford is where he bought land and property, where he kept his library, where he lived and read and thought.
The anniversary of the death of the man from Stratford, the most famous and the most performed playwright in the world, will be marked across Britain and the globe.
Macbeth will open in Singapore, Romeo and Juliet in Brussels.
In London, they are also creating a 37-screen pop-up cinema, one screen to showcase each of Shakespeares plays, along the South Bank.
The National Theatre, the Royal Shakespeare Company and virtually every other theatre production company in the country will be marking the anniversary.
There will also be hundreds of lectures, recitals, international academic conferences,  lms, concerts, operas and major exhibitions.
For a man famous in his own lifetime, there is little documentary evidence for Shakespeares life and times.
The actor Mark Rylance has called it his favourite book in the world and most of the surviving First Folios will be on display  including those belonging to the British and Bodleian libraries, and a tattered copy recently discovered in France.
The general public and many academics have consistently underestimated the importance of Stratford to Shakespeare.
Hearing a click off a salmon is probably one of the most challenging things a killer whale does.
Hearing that subtle click is harder if theres a lot of noise around you.
The researchers used underwater microphones to measure the noise created by about 1,600 individual ships as they passed through Haro Strait, in Washington State.
The two-year study captured the sounds made by 12 different types of vessel, including cruise ships, container ships and military vehicles, that passed through the strait about 20 times a day.
Some ships are quieter than others but the average intensity of noise next to all the ships was 173 underwater decibels, equivalent to 111 decibels through the air  about the sound of a loud rock concert.
Whales are not usually located right next to ships and so would be subjected to noise of about 60 to 90 decibels  around the level of a lawnmower or a vacuum cleaner.
Most noise is at that low frequency but the background noise of the ocean is raised even in the high frequencies.
Decreasing speed by six knots could decrease noise intensity by half.
Under the same conditions, a quarter of women pressed the shock button.
The report from psychologists at Virginia and Harvard Universities is one of a surprising few to tackle the question of why most of us  nd it so hard to do nothing.
The only rules were they had to stay seated and not fall asleep.
On average, they did not enjoy the experience.
To the researchers surprise, 12 of 18 men gave themselves up to four electric shocks, as did six of 24 women.
Imagine the setup  a person is told to sit in a chair with wires attached to their skin and a button that will deliver a harmless but uncomfortable shock, and they are told to just sit there and entertain themselves with their thoughts, she said.
Enter a department store and you will be watched.
Its that you need to know that this shopper has these characteristics and, in the past, that when those characteristics are present, this is what a person tends to do.
If it sounds familiar, its because the online world has been using techniques like these for years.
If I just showed you a shot of someones body you could probably tell me what gender they are.
We allow this to happen online so why not of ine?
Among 6- to 7-year-olds, who have grown up with YouTube, Spotify music streaming and online television, the average DQ score was 98, higher than for those aged between 45 and 49, who scored an average of 96.
The most remarkable change is in time spent talking on the phone.
For those aged 12 to 15, phone calls account for just 3% of time spent communicating through any device.
For all adults, this rises to 20% and, for young adults, it is still three times as high at 9%.
Away from their phones, 12- to 15-year-olds have a very different relationship with other media, too.
They spend 20% of their time viewing short video clips, for example on YouTube, or news clips distributed via Facebook and other social sites.
The rest of their viewing is shared between DVDs, streamed content through Net ix or iTunes and recorded television programmes.
From 2006 to 2008, Duran took out 68 commercial and personal loans from 39 banks in Spain.
He spent two months in prison before being bailed for 50,000.
More than 25,000 kilos of dead  sh were collected in the aftermath and nearly 2,000 adult birds, chicks, eggs and nests were killed or destroyed.
It was Spains worst environmental disaster and the clean-up cost 90m.
"There are riches here, riches that are badly needed by local inhabitants, said Vicente Fernandez Guerrero, secretary-general of Innovation, Industry and Energy for Andalucia.
People have been digging metals and ores here since Roman times, after all.
The best technology in the world will be used here, Fernandez insisted.
For his part, Carlos Davila, who works for the Spanish Ornithological Society in Donana, was also alarmed at the proposal.
This is a very, very bad idea indeed, he told me.
The trouble is that Spain does not have the public resources it possessed 16 years ago.
After the disaster, Spain woke up to the fact that it possessed a place of real ecological importance and did a lot to clean it up and protect it, he added.
It shows the power of Star Wars that, although they were disappointing, the prequels still managed to make a lot of money, said Rosser.
We may not yet be living in an age of  ying cars, as predicted in the 1985  lm Back to the Future II, but the rise of smartphones and other new technologies is creating a reality that is arguably as exciting and almost as far-fetched.
Communication between riders and drivers, between different vehicles and between cars and infrastructure is bringing transportation into a new era, according to Allan Clelland, an expert on transportation technology.
According to the study, those born in the 1990s are making 4% fewer car trips and travelling 18% fewer miles per year, on average, than members of previous generations did at the same stage in their lives.
Companies are working to develop technology that will enable a vehicle to tell traf c control systems not only that it is present but also where it is going and how fast it is travelling.
Automation Driverless cars have been in the headlines ever since Google began road testing the vehicles back in 2012 but no-one really knows when driverless cars will become commonplace.

The Mesolithic man, who lived in Spain around 7,000 years ago, had an unusual mix of blue eyes, black or brown hair and dark skin, according to analyses of his genetic make-up.
The Spanish team started their work after a group of cavers stumbled upon two skeletons in a deep and complex cave system high up in the Cantabrian Mountains of northwest Spain in 2006.
This guy had to be darker than any modern European, but we dont know how dark, the scientist said.
You see a lot of reconstructions of these people hunting and gathering and they look like modern Europeans with light skin.
You never see a reconstruction of a Mesolithic hunter-gatherer with dark skin and blue eye colour, Lalueza-Fox said.
The Spanish team went on to compare the genome of the hunter-gatherer to those of modern Europeans from different regions to see how they might be related.
But, in 2013, one of the mothers, who is 33 and unemployed, sued her ex-partner for maintenance for her daughter.
A DNA test was done and it was found it was not his baby and not her baby.
Its four years later: you can understand she doesnt want to give up her baby.
But, whatever happens, someone wont be happy.
Karabo Ngidi, a lawyer with the centre, said Whats going to happen must be in the best interests of the children.
In 1995, two mothers were awarded damages after their sons, born in 1989, were accidentally switched at the Johannesburg hospital where they were born.
Tourist numbers are down 80% this year, said Mayor Maria Kakali, in an of ce in the village where she grew up, home to around 200 people.
If we have to pay a tax of 23%, Im sorry to say it but we will all die on the island, says Kakali.
It has just over 3,000 beds for visitors, compared with tens of thousands on an island such as Rhodes.
The truth is the government doesnt pay much attention to the islands of the north Aegean, she said, so I would take all the kids from our school to the gates of parliament, to tell them: There is still life in these islands. 
The age of the big British summer music festival, including Glastonbury, is drawing to a close, according to the leading rock promoter and manager Harvey Goldsmith.
That is a big, big problem in our industry.
And, we are not producing a new generation of these kind of acts  the likes of the Rolling Stones, Muse, even the Arctic Monkeys  that can headline.
There were about 900 music festival events in the UK between May and September 2014, he said, and there is no way they can all continue.
He didnt want to risk leaving the US  it was him, not Elvis, said Goldsmith.
Freddie Mercury had to be our most powerful stage performer, the best live performer weve ever had.
Were not producing a new generation of this kind of act.
Coldplay is probably the last one to come up and that was ten years ago.
So, with no big acts to headline, there are no big shows.
What is it like to look at the very last of something?
If he does not mate successfully soon with one of two female northern white rhinos at Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya, there will be no more of their kind, male or female, born anywhere.
Apart from these three animals, there are only two other northern white rhinos in the world, both in zoos, both female.
His eye is a sad black dot in his massive wrinkled face as he wanders the reserve with his guards.
It is a majestic rectangle of strong bone and leathery  esh, a head that expresses pure strength.
Human beings  we always kill the things we love.
But the same people who painted such sensitive portraits of Ice Age rhinos helped to kill them off.
The northern white rhino is the rarest species of African rhino.
There are far greater numbers of southern white rhinos and black rhinos.
From 2007, when just 13 rhinos were killed by poachers in South Africa, the killings have grown horri cally.
In 2014, 1,215 rhinos were slaughtered for their horns in South Africa.
In 2006, the Irish designer completed a scuba-diving course and loved the feeling of being able to breathe underwater and observe  sh in their natural environment.
Although it allows you to stay underwater for longer, you have to plan your whole day around it.
You have 20kg to 50kg of gear with you  you cant be walking on the beach and decide you want to go in.
It was during a  nal-year project for his product design degree at the University of Limerick that Redmond produced the Express Dive.
The device can take in enough air for two minutes of diving and takes approximately the same amount of time to be re lled.
Redmond says the mouthpiece feels similar to using a snorkel.
The typical swimmer can hold their breath for about 40 seconds while underwater, he says.
A lot of my job is listening to peoples lives all day, every day and it started to feel so overwhelming to go on social media and see every single detail of everybodys life, including people that I dont really have a relationship with, she said.
One thing I really liked about Facebook was that I could sit for hours and click on a friend and then click on one of their friends and one of their friends and one of their friends and literally end up on someones Facebook page from the other side of the world, she said.
I wonder what it would be like if I didnt spend these seconds here and spent them doing something else.
He spends his lift rides and spare moments at work reading news articles and books rather than scrolling through a newsfeed.
And with no friends accounts to follow online, he has to pick up the phone and call them, something hes come to de nitely enjoy.
Lauren Raskauskas, 22, Naples, Florida Raskauskas describes herself as a pretty private person.
She recently deleted her Twitter account and deactivated her Facebook account two years ago after realizing she didnt like everyone knowing what I was doing.
He claims that he hasnt seen any effect at this point.
Even though classmates post about parties and events on Facebook, they make sure to send him a text message, too, he said.
His billing, The Beale Street Blues Boy, was shortened to Blues Boy King and thence to BB.
But he would also cite the earlier blues guitarists Blind Lemon Jefferson and Lonnie Johnson and the jazz players Charlie Christian and Django Reinhardt.
He once explained that his guitar technique was partly based on his lack of skill: I started to bend notes because I could never play in the bottleneck style, like Elmore James and Booker White.
About a year and a half ago, he said in 1969, all of a sudden, kids started coming up to me saying, Youre the greatest blues guitarist in the world.
Smokers are the key group for e-cigarette  rms because seven out of ten vapers are smokers.
Numbers who use e-cigarettes while continuing to smoke are going down, West said.
Weve only been tracking vaping for just over a year, so its a short time period, but we are not seeing growth in the number of long-term ex-smokers or never smokers using e-cigarettes.
Our customers are still very happy with the product, and technology and innovation in hardware is improving user experience and helping them to switch from traditional cigarettes.
They are more popular than nicotine patches and may or may not be more effective.
There is a tendency among some local authorities and organizations to treat e-cigarettes as cigarettes and ban them in public places and outdoors, he said.
Vienna is the worlds best city to live in, Baghdad is the worst and London, Paris and New York do not even make it into the top 35, according to international research into quality of life.
German-speaking cities dominate the rankings in the 18th Mercer Quality of Life study, with Vienna joined by Zurich, Munich, Dusseldorf and Frankfurt in the top seven.
You dont realize how safe Vienna is until you head abroad, said Hartlauer.
We also have terri c public transport, with the underground working 24 hours at weekends, and it only costs 1 per trip.
The fall of the Berlin Wall helped de ne Vienna as the hub for companies wanting to do business in Central Europe.
Zurich in Switzerland is named by Mercer as having the worlds second highest quality of life but the Viennese say their city is far more fun.
We asked waiters around the UK what they think of the tipping process (including how much they take home from tips and whether its fair) and what would improve it for them.
Rodri, 37, London: Around 50% of a waiters income is tips Average tips: 60 per eight-hour shift I think they treat waiters best in ... the US  Everything has got fairer since the tipping scandal was exposed in the summer of 2015.
However, you still hear horror stories from new employees at some chains.
I can average around 60 in tips per shift but, on a good night, this goes up to over 100 and, on a poor night, its around 40.
Elle, 22, Edinburgh: We never know whether its fair Average tips: 20 per eight-hour shift I think they treat waiters best in ... France  I work three jobs, all on part-time zero-hours contracts, in catering and hospitality.
In restaurants, because a lot of customers add tips through card payments, the staff never actually see how much is getting tipped  so we dont know whether were getting our fair share or not.
Its really unfair that tips go towards breakages made by customers.
The managers should have ways to pay for broken glasses and plates without docking our tips.
I make around 20 a shift but would only be given 10-15 of that money.
I really rely on tips because I am only paid 7 an hour.
Tom, Manchester: A big night of tips can help pay the rent Average tips: 40 per eight-hour shift I think they treat waiters best in ... Italy  Where I used to work,  oor staff kept 80% of cash tips and 40% of card tips.
Its hard to say how much I earned a shift; maybe around 40, 20 from card tips.
They have got tipping right in Italy, where people dont add a service charge but usually round up their bill so, if they get a meal for 19, they leave a 20 note and dont ask for change.
A more open and connected world is a better world.
You wont be surprised by an ex in the street with a new girlfriend or boyfriend: you already know theyre dating someone else from the romantic sel es.
It doesnt necessarily mean we see them the same way.
Professor Robin Dunbar is famous for his research that suggests a person can only have roughly 150 people as a social group.
An overwhelming majority of 91% post a photo of themselves, 71% post the city or town where they live, up from 61%, more than half give email addresses and a  fth give their phone number.
The data and analytics available to you are extraordinary.
4 Facebook has been the tool to organize revolutions Though the Arab Spring was dubbed the Twitter revolution, organizing demonstrations and direct action has been revolutionized by Facebook.
5 Facebook makes news, breaks news and decides what is news Roughly 71% of 18- to 24-year-olds say the internet is their main news source and 63% of users overall, according to the Pew Research Center.
And 39% are connected to people they have never met in person.
We may as well get used to it, said David Kirkpatrick, author of The Facebook Effect.
If the amount of food wasted around the world were reduced by just 25%, there would be enough food to feed all the people who are malnourished, according to the UN.
Each year, 1.3bn tonnes of food, about a third of all that is produced, is wasted, including about 45% of all fruit and vegetables, 35% of  sh and seafood, 30% of cereals, 20% of dairy products and 20% of meat.
In the developing world, food waste is virtually non-existent, says Robert van Otterdijk, coordinator of the UN Food and Agriculture Organizations Save Food programme.
Food waste is happening in countries where people can afford to throw away food.
The foods most commonly found in British bins are bread, vegetables, fruit and milk.
By percentage, the most wasted food is lettuce and leafy salads, of which consumers throw away 38% (64,000 tonnes) of all they buy.
Cockrell, a former Wall Street worker turned therapist, spends large parts of his days walking through Central Park or the Battery Park in downtown Manhattan near Wall Street, as a con dant and counsellor to some of New Yorks wealthiest people.
Many of the extremely wealthy  the 1% of the 1%  feel that their problems are really not problems.
There is the feeling that they have to hide the fact that they are rich.
And, then, there is the isolation  being in the 1%, it turns out, can be lonely.
The media, she said, is partly to blame for making the rich feel like they need to hide or feel ashamed.
Since the 2008  nancial crisis, the income gap has expanded and the situation has gotten worse for the wealthy, Cockrell said.
Never being able to trust your friendships with people of different means, I think that is dif cult, said Cockrell.
Some Americans have taken to keeping their wealth secret.
There are a lot of people that are hiding their wealth because they are concerned about negative judgment, said Traeger-Muney.
If you are part of the 1%, you still have problems and they are legitimate to you.
Money is not the only thing that de nes you, he said.
Is this the moment when streaming goes truly mainstream?
Apple is good at mainstreaming products but its not that good.
Apple, and the record industry, cannot afford to get rid of the download market just yet  so streaming and downloading will have to coexist under the Apple brand, one representing the future as the other gets progressively slower and sicker.

I manage one minute and 12 seconds.
At a pool in Bristol, she taught me some simple exercises to help me hold my breath for longer while swimming underwater.
I asked how she did it: very slow breathing for several minutes prior to each dive, then a big, deep breath before diving in.
At least, it doesnt if youre breath-holding on land.
When you breathe in, youre contracting the muscle of your diaphragm, pulling it  at so that the volume of your chest increases  and air is drawn into your lungs.

The website ATMInventor.com concludes: Who invented the idea of an ATM?
In the section about great British inventions of the twentieth century, it states: In the 1960s, James Goodfellow (1937-) invented the cash-dispensing automatic teller machine (ATM) or cashpoint.
So after all these years, Goodfellow  nally  nds himself being talked about in the same breath as John Logie Baird (the television), Alan Turing (the Turing machine), Sir Frank Whittle (the jet engine) and Sir Tim Berners-Lee (the World Wide Web).
British people think the top 1% wealthiest households own 59% of their countrys wealth, when they actually only own 23%.
Americans think that 33% of their population are immigrants, when in fact it is only 14%.
In Britain, people think that an extraordinary 43% of young adults aged 25-34 still live at home with their parents, rather than the actual 14%.
The worst case is Saudi Arabia, where people think only 28% are, when 71% are.
Britons think it is 44%, when it is actually nearly half as much again  62% are either overweight or obese.
And, in many ways, it is not our misperceptions but these realities across different countries that are the most interesting and important aspects of the study.
Thats 65 litres of clean, drinkable water that were infusing with soap and washing down the drain each and every day  sometimes more than once.
The vital importance of clean water is becoming harder and harder to ignore, as California enters another summer of drought.

The conventional school starting time works for 10-year-olds but not 16- to 18-year-olds.
For the older teenagers, it might be more sensible to start the school day at 11am or even later.
Kelley says the working day should be more forgiving of our natural rhythms.
Describing the average sleep loss per night for different age groups, he says: Between 14 and 24, its more than two hours.
For people aged between 24 and about 30 or 35, its about an hour and a half.
Kelley says that synchronized hours could have many positive consequences.
The positive side of this is peoples performance, mood and health will improve.
Its very uplifting in a way because its a solution that will make people less ill, and happier and better at what they do.
A later start to the day for many, says Kelley, is something that would bene t everyone, particularly families.
And, yes, he says he  nds the start of his working day much easier now than he did when he was younger. 
Maybe GPS signals are blocked or partially blocked, in which case its going to have an incorrect idea about where it is.
One major problem is maintaining radio contact with a drone and planning for what happens if that contact breaks.
If you have a vehicle that can go into a neighbourhood, it can deliver from that base.
You need a 15-minute distance and typical off-the-shelf drones have about that distance.
The Reaper drone has one failure in 10,000 hours, Singh said.
Part of this is simply that air travel is inherently dangerous and, thus, standards are much higher.
Lots of her friends cant pay for heating or medication and many would go hungry if it were not for the East Hampton Food Pantry, she says, which is just one of several food pantries in the town.

Some danced, some posed for photos, some drank, but mostly they just walked and talked football, waiting for the next game to begin on the nearby FanFest big screen.
The trip has not been problem free.
His son, Andrew, had his sunglasses stolen almost as soon as he sat on the beach.
And, they have been surprised that many bars are not set up with big screens for the games.
But, like many fans, they said they loved the atmosphere, if not the logistics, of this tournament which has got off to a spectacular start on the pitch.
Elsewhere, there has been a glut of goals: 28 in the  rst eight games  almost three times as many as at the same stage in South Africa in 2010.
The Globo newspaper listed a number of shortcomings in the 12 host cities.
The worst transport problems were in Natal, where bus drivers have been on strike since 12 June.
But, protests have diminished since the opening day, when small demonstrations took place in several cities, prompting police to use tear gas and pepper spray.
Since then, the only security threat has been petty theft and overexcited fans.
But, these days, the golden arches of McDonalds are looking a little tarnished.
Almost 60 years after Ray Kroc opened his  rst restaurant in Des Plaines, Illinois, consumers are losing their appetite for a Big Mac and fries.
The number of 19-to-21-year-olds visiting McDonalds once a month has fallen by 13% since 2011, according to food analysts Technomic, while the number of 22-to-37-year- olds visiting has not grown.
To add to the companys problems, McDonalds hamburgers were recently named the worst in America in a poll of more than 32,000 American  diners, who said they would rather eat a burger at Five Guys, Smashburger or Fuddruckers.
Have you ever used pink slime in your burgers?
Ever since it introduced $2 items on its dollar menu, it has gained a reputation for being more expensive than its rivals, while many consumers complain that service is slower.
Prices have indeed gone up but they havent gone up as quickly as the rest of the fast-service chains in the US.
McDonalds has a bigger menu than some, with more complicated items  its chicken McWrap takes 60 seconds to make.
Only four out of McDonalds 14,000 US restaurants had so far tested build your own burger, he said, raising questions about how it could be scaled up.
Faehrmann said the protests had shown Australians wanted sharks protected: Whats amazing is so many people in Australia love sharks.
Anthony Joyce, a surfer who once had his foot caught in a sharks mouth, said: The number of sharks they are going to kill is going to make no difference in the scheme of things.
Conservationists argue there is no evidence the cull will reduce the number of shark attacks on humans, as no previous cull has solely used drumlines.
Researchers at the University of Western Australia say the recent spate of shark attacks in the state may have more to do with the state having the fastest-growing population in Australia, rather than a rising number of sharks.
The activity in Western Australia is compounding the human tragedy of shark attacks.

Retailer Sports Direct recently became the focus of controversy on zero-hours when it emerged that the company employs around 20,000 of its 23,000 staff on the contracts.
The retailers use of the contracts was followed by details of a string of other companies using the deals, including cinema chain Cineworld and Buckingham Palace, which uses them for its 350 summer workers.
Pub group J D Wetherspoon has 24,000 of its staff  80% of its workforce  on the terms.
Dave Prentis, of the trade union Unison, said: The vast majority of workers are only on these contracts because they have no choice.
The charity National Trust, which employs many of its seasonal workers on zero-hours contracts, said it offered the same pay and bene ts to those workers, pro rata, as full-time staff, but needed some workers to be on a more  exible arrangement.
Our properties have told us its important to be able to reorganize staff rotas quickly to respond to the weather and zero-hours contracts allow us to do this.
While some employees welcome the  exibility of such contracts, for many, zero-hours contracts leave them insecure and unsure of when work will come, he said.
The institutes  gures also suggest that 17% of employers in the private sector made use of zero- hours contracts, considerably lower than the 34% of organizations in the voluntary sector and 24% in the public sector.
Industries where employers were most likely to report at least one person on a zero-hours contract were hotels, catering and leisure (48%), education (35%) and healthcare (27%).
