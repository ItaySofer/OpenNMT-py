You also need a strong sense of personal ethics and an understanding of the law.
Quali cations: A private-helicopter-pilot licence, a commercial pilots licence and around 2,000 hours of experience  ying at low levels in the type of helicopter the company usually uses.
Typically, pilots must  y beside the power line, sometimes as little as 20 feet away and just 30 feet off the ground.
Retailer Sports Direct recently became the focus of controversy on zero-hours when it emerged that the company employs around 20,000 of its 23,000 staff on the contracts.
The retailers use of the contracts was followed by details of a string of other companies using the deals, including cinema chain Cineworld and Buckingham Palace, which uses them for its 350 summer workers.
Pub group J D Wetherspoon has 24,000 of its staff  80% of its workforce  on the terms.
Dave Prentis, of the trade union Unison, said: The vast majority of workers are only on these contracts because they have no choice.
The charity National Trust, which employs many of its seasonal workers on zero-hours contracts, said it offered the same pay and bene ts to those workers, pro rata, as full-time staff, but needed some workers to be on a more  exible arrangement.
Our properties have told us its important to be able to reorganize staff rotas quickly to respond to the weather and zero-hours contracts allow us to do this.
While some employees welcome the  exibility of such contracts, for many, zero-hours contracts leave them insecure and unsure of when work will come, he said.
The institutes  gures also suggest that 17% of employers in the private sector made use of zero- hours contracts, considerably lower than the 34% of organizations in the voluntary sector and 24% in the public sector.
Industries where employers were most likely to report at least one person on a zero-hours contract were hotels, catering and leisure (48%), education (35%) and healthcare (27%). 
He gets what all referees hope for every time they referee a match.
A few weeks earlier, Riley, Dunn and another former referee, Peter Jones, made their way to another level-5 match to monitor another referee tipped to progress  John Brooks.
A little later, the football club secretary arrived with envelopes to pay the officials for their time  the match fee at level 5 is 95 so it is safe to assume these men do not do it for the cash.
How does he feel watching football on TV when a referee gets vilified?
Riley, as a young referee, went out and bought himself books on psychology and nutrition as there was no information on offer to him at all.
Riley, as a young referee, went out and bought himself books on psychology and nutrition as there was no information on offer to him at all.
He also has the support of a sports psychologist, Liam Slack, for regular guidance and an exercise regime to help him handle the 11km he runs during a game.
We are all in favour of anything that makes the referees job better and makes them more effective on the field of play, says Riley.
Buildings warm up in a number of different ways.
The Stanford mirror was designed in such a way that it re ects 97% of the visible light that falls on it.
When the mirror is warmed up, it releases heat at a speci c wavelength of infrared light that passes easily through the atmosphere and out into space.
You could use this on buildings so you have to spend much less on air conditioning or maybe you wouldnt need it at all.
You could put it on top of shopping malls.
The project is a key plank in Moroccos ambitions to use its untapped deserts to become a global solar superpower.
When they are  nished, the four plants at Ouarzazate will occupy a space as big as Moroccos capital city, Rabat, and generate 580 mega-watts (MW) of electricity, enough to power a million homes.
Solar energy will make up a third of Moroccos renewable energy supply by 2020, with wind and hydro taking the same share each.
Whether that ambition is achieved remains to be seen but exporting solar energy could have stabilizing effects within and between countries, according to the Moroccan solar energy agency (Masen).
We believe that its possible to export energy to Europe but,  rst, we would have to build the interconnectors which dont yet exist, said Maha el-Kadiri, a Masen spokeswoman.
In a three-year period, the number of paying subscribers rose from 8 million to 28 million, according to the 2014 digital music report from the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI).
Easily accessible from smartphones and tablets, subscription services are popular with people looking to try out new music without committing to buying a download or a CD.
Retailers are becoming increasingly aware that shoppers who are prepared to set foot in a physical store want a service and an experience they cant get online, says Simon Boydell, spokesman for Marketforce, which has more than 300,000 mystery shoppers on its books.
Our clients want to measure how well their stores are delivering on that experience.
Each day, they typically spend up to eight hours visiting  ve to ten stores, plus another hour or two  ling detailed reports on every aspect of their visit.
Shoppers are usually repaid any money they spend in the stores and may also be allowed to keep the products they buy.
Im always given a scenario, such as buying something from a speci c department or a new product range, but, within that framework, I can often buy whatever I want  and keep it.
Her income is typically 30,000 to 40,000 a year and that doesnt include all the freebies she gets on the job.
She does, however,  nd it satisfying to return to a store she has previously mystery shopped and see standards have improved.
Marketforce shoppers typically get a couple of pounds for a visit as a token gesture for their time and effort, says Boydell.
I wont touch those jobs anymore.
Hannah, a 41-year-old City lawyer, has conducted nearly 500 visits for the Mystery Dining Company in her spare time without receiving remuneration or travel expenses.
When the Russian capsule opened on to the cool air of Kazakhstan, Kelly said, he smelled a fragrance like a plant was blooming in that area.
He said the message we need to save the planet slightly missed the point: The planet will get better; its us that wont be here because well destroy the environment.
A single brain spot is associated with a number of related words.
And, each single word lights up many different brain spots.
It is possible that this approach could be used to decode information about what words a person is hearing, reading or possibly even thinking, said Alexander Huth, the  rst author on the study.
Per person, that amounted to hearing roughly 25,000 words  and more than 3,000 different words  as they lay in the scanner.
The atlas shows how words and related terms exercise the same regions of the brain.
The same region responds to killed, convicted, murdered and confessed.
On the brains right-hand side, near the top of the head, is one of the brain spots activated by family terms: wife, husband, children, parents.
Each word is represented by more than one spot because words tend to have several meanings.
One part of the brain, for example, reliably responds to the word top, along with other words that describe clothing.
One of them responds to numbers and measurements, another to buildings and places.
The scientists only scanned  ve men and two women, however.
It is highly possible that people from different backgrounds and cultures will have different semantic brain atlases.
Forcing people outside the bar to smoke is going to exacerbate the tension thats already there.
Martha Wood lives beside a loud bar that hosts live music.
Theres no way I could have banned smoking in my bar without it being a rule throughout the whole city, says Douville.
Smoker Neil Timms owns an English pub and met the smoking ban before, in England.
To avoid the same fate, hes spending money to build a patio.
Lost Loves Douville, though, feels the ban to be a great business opportunity.
The number of people who would enjoy coming out to our bar, with our food, but would never come because they didnt want to smell like smoke for the next seven days  were now an option for all those people.
Councilwoman LaToya Cantrell, who introduced and pushed the ban, disagrees: The responsibility is on the bar-owner to keep their clientele respectful outside their establishment as well, she says.
The owners and bartenders need to tell them to go have a smoke but be respectful to their communities.
I think its about communication and creating partnerships between the communities and the businesses.
Bar customers are encouraged to come  ll out a form or call 311 and to include date-and-time-stamped photographs documenting illegal smoking.
Unworried, Geoff Douville says that hes used to noise complaints by now so bring on the ban.
But it doesnt mean theyre gonna win. 
This learned deafness is a real issue, Fristrup told the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in San Jose.
We are conditioning ourselves to ignore the information coming into our ears.
This gift that we are born with  to reach out and hear things hundreds of metres away, all these incredible sounds  is in danger of being lost through a generational amnesia, he said.
For the past ten years, the US National Park Service has recorded sound levels at more than 600 sites across the US, including Yosemite in California, Yellowstone and Denali in Alaska.
If  nding peace and quiet becomes dif cult enough, many, many children will grow up without the experience and I think its a very real problem, he said.
Speaking at the same meeting, Derrick Taff, a social scientist at Pennsylvania State University, described preliminary experiments which suggest that listening to recordings from national parks, of waterfalls, birdsong and wind, helped people recover from stressful events.
Valter Piscedda, the centre- left mayor of Elmas, a small town near Sardinias capital, Cagliari, wants to pay residents to leave.
This is, above all, an idea born of common sense and experience, he told the Guardian.
And they want to go and gain work experience abroad; life experience, too.
In Elmas, the scheme has provoked mixed reactions.
The reality is that there is little work here, said Alessandro Macis.
said Consuelo Melis, who works behind the bar in a local cafe.
The work I can create, as mayor, is temporary.
Robert Mys_ajek stops dead.
There are now an estimated 1,500 wolves in Poland.
Wolves are  along with the brown bear, the lynx and the wolverine  Europes last large predator carnivores.
DNA tests have established that Polish wolves are travellers.
Mys_ajek says only scienti c arguments  the need to regenerate forests and control the wild animal population  can save Europes wild carnivores, especially the unpopular wolf.
In 1989, when the communists relinquished power, Poland had only one motorway.
The Environment Minister, Jan Szyszko, makes no secret of being a hunter.
It is not as if you can argue to the politicians that wolves are a big tourist attraction.
Tom Sanders, a professor of nutrition at Kings College London, said the research did show some differences.
The results of the research are based on an analysis of 343 peer-reviewed studies from around the world  more than ever before  which examine differences between organic and conventional fruit, vegetables and cereals.
Leifert and his colleagues conclude that many antioxidants have previously been linked to a reduced risk of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases and certain cancers.
The researchers found much higher levels of cadmium, a toxic metal, in conventional crops.
A further criticism is that the differences seen may result from different climates, soil types and crop varieties, and not from organic farming, though the researchers argue that combining many studies should average out these other differences.
Browning said: This research backs up what people think about organic food.
In other countries, there have long been much higher levels of support and acceptance of the bene ts of organic food and farming.
The canoe is our island, the crew members are the community and the navigator is the leader, Pittman says.
On a canoe, you are not just going from one destination to another using the stars, the moon, the sun and the birds.
The of cial title of the expedition is the Mua Voyage and it is a partnership between the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Oceania Regional Of ce and  ve Paci c Island countries: Samoa, Tonga, New Zealand, the Cook Islands and Fiji.
The main goal of the 6,000-nautical-mile (11,000km) trip was to deliver a special message to the World Parks Congress.
According to the IUCN, as of 2013, the amount of the worlds oceans in marine protected areas was not even three per cent and less than one per cent of that is no take.
And the effects of climate change were already beginning to impact seriously on Paci c Islanders.
I work hard and am good at my job but, when PizzaExpress thinks it can get away with taking a percentage of our hard-earned tips left on a card, I get upset.
PizzaExpress joins restaurant chains Ask and Zizzi in siphoning off 8% of the tips paid by card but other chains deduct even more.
Cafe_ Rouge, Bella Italia and Belgo deduct 10%, as do Strada and Giraffe, which is owned by Tesco.
Almost 6,000 people have so far signed Unites online petition.
One waiter, who doesnt work for PizzaExpress but has worked for 11 years for another restaurant chain, said that at least a third of his income is from tips.
The way clouds affect global warming has been the biggest mystery surrounding future climate change.
4C would likely be catastrophic rather than simply dangerous, Sherwood said.
For example, it would make life difficult, if not impossible, in much of the tropics and would guarantee the eventual melting of the Greenland ice sheet and some of the Antarctic ice sheet, with sea levels rising by many metres as a result.
When water evaporates from the oceans, the vapour can rise over nine miles to form rain clouds that reflect sunlight; or, it may rise just a few miles and drift back down without forming clouds.
Climate sceptics like to criticize climate models for getting things wrong and we are the first to admit they are not perfect, said Sherwood.
But what we are finding is that the mistakes are being made by the models which predict less warming, not those that predict more.
Even in successful countries such as Indonesia and Vietnam, the proportion has been 20%.
Amin, 61, from rural Bangladesh, has seen his livelihood gradually decline, due to his own and his wifes illnesses, the cost of his sons marriage, the death of his father and loss of goods such as  shing nets.
Lovemore, 74, from Zimbabwe, has become one of the poorest people in his village.
He recently lost his job as a car-park attendant due to ill health and had to take in his  ve grandchildren after the death of his daughters.
The second is education, from early childhood to the start of work, to enable people to escape and stay out of poverty.
Even Nigeria, with its oil wealth, spends only $650 per capita, Shepherd said.
We Can Do It is not a female beer but a beer brewed by women that anyone can drink, she says.
One weekend they concocted the recipe and the next they brewed 1,600 litres.
This is not a beer that is aimed at women  its our hoppiest brew, says Thomas Bingebo, the head brewer at Ocean.
FemAle has already been approached by other breweries asking if they can brew new beers with them.
From all across Rwanda, and even parts of neighbouring Burundi, people  ock to the southern town of Butare to a little shop called Inzozi Nziza (Sweet Dreams).
Here, at the central African countrys  rst ice- cream parlour, customers can buy scoops in sweet cream, passion fruit, strawberry and pineapple  avours.
Ice cream is important, she says between mouthfuls of a honey- avoured offering.
True to Inzozi Nzizas motto, the shop can certainly make dreams come true.
Its something uniting people here, Kalisa Migendo, a 24-year-old agriculture student, says.
Inzozi Nziza was opened by the theatre director Odile Gakire Katese.
The musicians are Hutu and Tutsi women, some survivors of the 1994 genocide, during which almost a million Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed.
When Im drumming with them, it gives me power because were still alive and survivors.
Schools should teach navigation and map reading as life skills, he wrote.
What we did was to look at a set of current London taxi drivers and a set of London taxi drivers that had been retired for about four years, said neuroscientist Dr Hugo Spiers, head of the Spatial Cognition Group at University College London, who is an author of the study.
The way in which navigational technology is used could also affect its impact on our own abilities, says Spiers.
Ultimately, McKinlay believes, its essential that humans remain able to take control of their navigation.
La Premiere chose quon regarde (The First Thing We Look At) by Gregoire Delacourt tells the story of a French model who looks so similar to the American actor that the books lead male character thinks it is Johansson herself.
In the novel, the models looks mean that men see her only as a sex object, while women are jealous of her.
She has a series of adventures as Johansson until she is eventually found out and, in the end, dies in a car crash.
Delacourt has become one of Frances best-loved authors; his previous novel, My List of Desires, was translated into 47 languages and is now being adapted into a  lm.
I wrote a real love story and a homage to feminine beauty, especially interior beauty.
I thought she might send me  owers as it was a declaration of love for her, but she didnt understand, Delacourt said.
All were tested between 2007 and 2010 on three different measures of  tness: stamina, handgrip strength and lower-body power.
The results revealed that a childs month of birth could make signi cant differences to their levels of cardiovascular  tness, muscle strength and ability to accelerate, all of which predict how good someone is at sport, in which such attributes are vital.
Those born in October were almost as  t, scoring highest for strength and coming third for power, with December children close behind.
The gap in physical prowess between children in the same class but born in different months was sometimes very wide.
This is, potentially, a huge physical advantage, said Sandercock.
Such gaps could ultimately decide who became a top-level athlete because, as the paper says, selection into elite sports may often depend on very small margins or differences in an individuals physical performance.
The  ndings seem to show that children born in the early months of the school year enjoy a double autumn advantage  they are already known to have an academic advantage and, now, they also appear to be better equipped for sport, too.
Children that get a high-quality  rst experience, which develops their physical literacy, are those that will have greater agility, balance and coordination, and are more likely to develop an enjoyment of physical activity and excel in sport as they grow up, he said.
As soon as the children at one primary school in Stirling hear the words daily mile, they down their pencils and head out of the classroom to start running laps around the school  eld.
For three-and-a-half years, all pupils at St Ninians Primary have walked or run a mile each day.
The thought of children across the country running every day because of something weve done is phenomenal.
In Stirling alone, 30 schools have already started or are to start the daily mile.
The most important thing is that the children really enjoy it; otherwise, you couldnt sustain it.
At St Ninians, teachers take their pupils out of lessons on to a specially built circuit around the schools playing  eld for their daily mile whenever it best suits that days timetable.
The extent of the bene ts have yet to be determined but researchers from Stirling University have launched a comparative study to look for quantitative evidence of the physical, cognitive and emotional bene ts of the daily mile.
Paralympian, Tanni Grey-Thompson, chair of ukactive, the UKs leading not-for-pro t health body for physical activity, said: All children need to achieve 60 active minutes every day, whether in a lesson, on the walk to school or in the playground.
We know sitting still kills; not sitting still helps children build skills that will stay with them for life.
The Scottish government is also supportive.
In what Mason called the  rst city-scale genetic pro le ever, his team found meningitis at Times Square, a trace of anthrax on the handhold of a train carriage and bacteria that cause bubonic plague on a rubbish bin and ticket machine at stations in uptown Manhattan.
All around the subway, bacteria associated with cheeses  brie, cheddar, parmesan and the mozzarella of ubiquitous New York pizza  turned up.
The distinctive bacteria of Swiss cheese were more localized to midtown Manhattan and the  nancial district, and the bacteria used to ferment cabbage for kimchi and sauerkraut showed up in the  nancial district and Bay Ridge.
Species that cause diarrhoea and nausea, both benign and bad E.coli (mostly benign), and the bacteria that can cause skin infections and urinary-tract infections were common all over the city.
He said he hoped the research would provide a baseline of research for health of cials and geneticists, and could help health of cials to be better prepared to prevent and track diseases and pathogens. 
The yes campaign scored four big successes, winning 53% of the vote in Scotlands largest city, Glasgow, 57% in Dundee and 51% in North Lanarkshire.
We have heard the voice of Scotland and, now, the millions of voices of England must be heard, he said.
Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, said the referendum was a vote from the Scottish people for change.
We know our country needs to change in the way it is governed and we know our country needs to change in who it is governed for.
Theyve been left out of all of this for the last 18 years.
We will continue to  ght with the facts because the facts are on our side, he said recently on a conference call with journalists and analysts.
Already in the pipeline are plans for a new shark exhibition in Orlando and an attraction in San Antonio that will allow customers to swim with dolphins in a naturalistic setting.
SeaWorlds shares, which were worth $39 in 2013, were changing hands for just under $18 in August 2015. 
Stratford remained hugely important throughout Shakespeares life, argues Paul Edmondson, the head of learning and research at the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust.
But Stratford is where he bought land and property, where he kept his library, where he lived and read and thought.
The anniversary of the death of the man from Stratford, the most famous and the most performed playwright in the world, will be marked across Britain and the globe.
Macbeth will open in Singapore, Romeo and Juliet in Brussels.
In London, they are also creating a 37-screen pop-up cinema, one screen to showcase each of Shakespeares plays, along the South Bank.
The National Theatre, the Royal Shakespeare Company and virtually every other theatre production company in the country will be marking the anniversary.
There will also be hundreds of lectures, recitals, international academic conferences,  lms, concerts, operas and major exhibitions.
For a man famous in his own lifetime, there is little documentary evidence for Shakespeares life and times.
The actor Mark Rylance has called it his favourite book in the world and most of the surviving First Folios will be on display  including those belonging to the British and Bodleian libraries, and a tattered copy recently discovered in France.
The general public and many academics have consistently underestimated the importance of Stratford to Shakespeare.
Hearing a click off a salmon is probably one of the most challenging things a killer whale does.
Hearing that subtle click is harder if theres a lot of noise around you.
The researchers used underwater microphones to measure the noise created by about 1,600 individual ships as they passed through Haro Strait, in Washington State.
The two-year study captured the sounds made by 12 different types of vessel, including cruise ships, container ships and military vehicles, that passed through the strait about 20 times a day.
Some ships are quieter than others but the average intensity of noise next to all the ships was 173 underwater decibels, equivalent to 111 decibels through the air  about the sound of a loud rock concert.
Whales are not usually located right next to ships and so would be subjected to noise of about 60 to 90 decibels  around the level of a lawnmower or a vacuum cleaner.
Most noise is at that low frequency but the background noise of the ocean is raised even in the high frequencies.
Decreasing speed by six knots could decrease noise intensity by half.
Under the same conditions, a quarter of women pressed the shock button.
The report from psychologists at Virginia and Harvard Universities is one of a surprising few to tackle the question of why most of us  nd it so hard to do nothing.
The only rules were they had to stay seated and not fall asleep.
On average, they did not enjoy the experience.
To the researchers surprise, 12 of 18 men gave themselves up to four electric shocks, as did six of 24 women.
Imagine the setup  a person is told to sit in a chair with wires attached to their skin and a button that will deliver a harmless but uncomfortable shock, and they are told to just sit there and entertain themselves with their thoughts, she said.
Enter a department store and you will be watched.
Its that you need to know that this shopper has these characteristics and, in the past, that when those characteristics are present, this is what a person tends to do.
If it sounds familiar, its because the online world has been using techniques like these for years.
If I just showed you a shot of someones body you could probably tell me what gender they are.
We allow this to happen online so why not of ine?
Among 6- to 7-year-olds, who have grown up with YouTube, Spotify music streaming and online television, the average DQ score was 98, higher than for those aged between 45 and 49, who scored an average of 96.
The most remarkable change is in time spent talking on the phone.
For those aged 12 to 15, phone calls account for just 3% of time spent communicating through any device.
For all adults, this rises to 20% and, for young adults, it is still three times as high at 9%.
Away from their phones, 12- to 15-year-olds have a very different relationship with other media, too.
They spend 20% of their time viewing short video clips, for example on YouTube, or news clips distributed via Facebook and other social sites.
The rest of their viewing is shared between DVDs, streamed content through Net ix or iTunes and recorded television programmes.
From 2006 to 2008, Duran took out 68 commercial and personal loans from 39 banks in Spain.
He spent two months in prison before being bailed for 50,000.
More than 25,000 kilos of dead  sh were collected in the aftermath and nearly 2,000 adult birds, chicks, eggs and nests were killed or destroyed.
It was Spains worst environmental disaster and the clean-up cost 90m.
"There are riches here, riches that are badly needed by local inhabitants, said Vicente Fernandez Guerrero, secretary-general of Innovation, Industry and Energy for Andalucia.
