Climate change is caused by our economy of production and consumption because it is out of balance with what the Earth can provide, says van Otterdijk.
Production of food is one of the biggest production sectors in the world and, if one-third of all this is wasted, you can imagine what a huge effect this has on the natural resources  on land, water, energy and greenhouse gas emissions.
The places that waste the most food are the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, where consumers waste 39% of all food purchased.
This means that 11.7% of all food purchased is wasted, which costs each family 700 a year.
The most wasted food in the UK by weight is bread, with consumers throwing away 414,000 tonnes (22.4%) of all bread purchased.
The UK has made progress in the past ten years after a campaign to reduce waste.
Between 2007 and 2012, the amount of food waste produced by UK households decreased by 21%, from 5.3m tonnes to 4.2m tonnes, largely due to greater awareness.
Van Otterdijk says there has been a very encouraging, unexpected, continuing interest in food waste and this enables campaigns around the world to gain momentum.
But, if it continues like this, maybe, after ten years, well have globally signi cant results.   
Clay Cockrell is sitting in his of ce across the street from 1 Central Park West, the address of the Trump International Hotel and Tower.
Cockrell, a former Wall Street worker who is now a therapist, spends large parts of his days walking through Central Park or the Battery Park in downtown Manhattan near Wall Street, as a con dant and counsellor to some of New Yorks wealthiest people  Many of the extremely wealthy  the 1% of the 1%  feel that their problems are really not problems.
So, what issues do Americas 1% have?
And, then, there is the isolation  being in the 1% can be lonely.
The Occupy Wall Street movement was a good one and had some important things to say about income inequality but it singled out the 1% as something negative, said Jamie Traeger-Muney, a wealth psychologist and founder of the Wealth Legacy Group.
Traeger-Muney runs a global business and specializes in working with inheritors, who often get a bad reputation in the press.
You would never refer to another group of people in the way that it seems perfectly normal to refer to wealthy people.
But its harder to talk about having money than it is to talk about not having money.
According to research from Spectrem Group, in 2014, the number of US households with $1m or more  excluding the value of their main home  increased by 500,000 to 10.1m.
Since the 2008  nancial crisis, the income gap has grown and the situation has gotten worse for the wealthy, Cockrell said.
Never being able to trust your friendships with other people, I think that is dif cult, said Cockrell.
These are real fears of the richest of the rich.
In 2007, the Gates Foundation and Boston Colleges Center on Wealth and Philanthropy started to document what it felt like to be in Americas 1%.
For the next four years, researchers surveyed 165 of Americas richest households  120 of those households have at least $25m.
The report, The Joys and Dilemmas of Wealth, was 500 pages long and seemed to prove the old saying that money cant buy happiness.
Some Americans keep their wealth secret.
There are a lot of people that hide their wealth because they are worried about negative judgment, said Traeger-Muney.
Speaking in his soft, soothing voice that makes you want to tell him all your worries, Cockrell said that a common mistake that many of his wealthy clients make is letting their money define them.
According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), there were only 41m subscribers using music streaming services around the world in 2014.
Some sources suggest that Apple is aiming to reach 100m subscribers, which, based on a subscription fee of $120 per year, would generate $12bn annually.
Apple is good at making products go mainstream but its not that good.
Apple managed to persuade consumers to pay for downloads and grew a huge business with an estimated 70% market share.
Apple holds the lions share of this  it is biggest music retailer in the world.
But download revenue reached a peak in 2013 in the UK at 283m and fell to 249m in 2014.
The decline in download sales hit the US in 2013 so Apple bought Beats in 2014 for $3bn in order to get into the premium headphone market and, also, to make the transition from music ownership (downloads) to music access (subscription streaming).
Apple, and the record industry, cannot afford to get rid of the download market just yet  so streaming and downloading will have to coexist under the Apple brand.
The average spend of a music buyer in the UK in 2014, for example, was just 39.52.
Apple have previously tried to be artist-friendly via iTunes.
It didnt work.
There is the smell of revolution in the air and Apple is making sure its on the right side of the battle.
This is going to be the interesting bit when the service goes live.
Getting exclusives for big albums will be crucial to streaming.
Apple was watching this carefully and making notes.
Nowadays, its lowest point, Piazza San Marco (only three feet above sea level) is inundated with water approximately 100 times a year.
In Venice, subsoil compaction (a result of industrial exploitation of the surrounding area) lowered the city by 20cm between 1950 and 1970.
Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam is also sinking by about 2cm a year  but thats nothing compared to Jakarta, which is dropping 10 to 20cm each year.
Unfortunately for the Indonesian capital, it has pumped out so much groundwater to support its population that the land above is drying out and compacting  this has created a bowl.
While there are many plans to save Venice  and Ho Chi Minh City and Jakarta are taking the problem seriously  the same cannot be said for Miami, where politicians refuse to admit the city has a serious environmental problem.
It is less than ten feet above sea level; an increasing number of tropical storms are inundating the city; and it is built on porous rock, which is absorbing the rising seawater.
This water then  lls the citys foundations and comes up through drains and pipes, forcing sewage upwards and polluting its fresh water.
In the Maldives, the populations of whole islands are now considering abandoning their homes.
The capital, Male_, population 153,379 and only four feet above sea level, has built a ten-foot sea wall at a cost of $63 million  but, long term, only a stabilization of rising sea levels will save it and the rest of the islands.
This city is just one example of a problem caused not so much by global warming as human over-expansion.
Californias dream of farming the desert made sense while its total population remained around half a million (in 1870)  but now the state is home to 38 million people, who own 32 million vehicles.
The daily water use in Rancho Mirage is more than 200 gallons per person, which is causing a man-made drought.
A 25% cut in water use has been implemented but this is unlikely to stabilize the resort, which is surrounded by sand and dust.
The long-term answer in Californias desert is likely to be the abandonment of some cities.
Fire is a growing threat to urban settlements in America  in fact, forest  res cause the most damage after severe storms, with 800 major  re disasters there between 1953 and 2014.
Many cities are  ghting a losing battle against nature but is it possible to identify the worlds most vulnerable city?
And, if they disappear, Males raison detre disappears, too.       
Im ready to give up at 45 seconds but I continue and it seems to get easier for a while.
By the end of the session, Id managed 90 seconds of breath-holding, enough to let me swim a width.
I asked how she did it: very slow breathing for several minutes before each dive, then a big, deep breath before diving in.
Some even say that humans have an ability to lower their heart rate in order to breath-hold for even longer.
And evidence shows that our heart rate doesnt drop during breath-holding.
This reduction in heart rate is just one of the physiological responses that are sometimes called the mammalian diving re ex.
While our ability to breath-hold may not be special, when we compare ourselves with other animals, its now becoming very useful in one particular area of medicine.
Radiotherapy for breast cancer involves pointing radiation, very precisely, at the tumour.
This may require several minutes of radiation and, so, its usually done in short periods, between breaths.
But, if the patient can keep her chest perfectly still for several minutes, it means that the entire dose can be given, in the right place, in one go.
The problem, of course, is that most people, just like me, cannot hold their breath for much longer than a minute.
When you breathe in, youre pulling the muscle of your diaphragm  at so that the volume of your chest increases  and air is pulled into your lungs.
If you arti cially raise oxygen levels and reduce carbon dioxide levels before a breath-hold, as in the Birmingham radiotherapy experiments, you may be able to delay tiredness in the diaphragm.
First, he outraged prisoners of war by doubting the heroism of Vietnam veteran John McCain because he allowed himself to be captured.
Trump has also insulted Mexican immigrants to the US, claimed that a Black Lives Matter protester who was violently thrown out of a rally deserved to be roughed up, appeared to laugh at a New York Times journalist for his disability and falsely accused Muslim Americans of supporting the 9/11 attackers.
But, he has refused to retract any of the comments.
Some rivals still hope that, eventually, even Trumps supporters will get tired of his attacks on minorities.
As he is happy to tell supporters, the three things that he is most against  immigration reform, free-trade deals and Barack Obamas national security policy  have become perhaps the most important issues of the election.
might sound unrealistic but they have destroyed the campaign hopes of Jeb Bush, who favours immigration reform.
Among Americans who say they are Republicans, current polls suggest he has 25-30% of the vote.
In the political battle for hearts and minds, converting Trumps passionate supporters will be hard.
This scenario can be best understood by looking at responses to the question: Which candidates would you de nitely not support for the Republican nomination for president?
Steve Deace, an Iowa conservative, said that Trumps behaviour is both a good and a bad thing.
On the other hand, it limits his ability to grow beyond that.
He says, Trump says what theyre thinking and, the more outrageous he is, the more they agree with him.
That is certainly the feeling among ordinary supporters who have attended his increasingly packed campaign events recently.
Sometimes life isnt fair.
There have been arguments for years over who is the inventor of the ATM and, in 2005, a man called John Shepherd-Barron received a UK honour as the inventor of the automatic cash dispenser.
But, the UK government is now saying it was Goodfellow who invented the ATM  so it seems that, after all the arguments, he now has his place in history.
Back in the mid-1960s, Goodfellow was working as a development engineer and was asked to devise a way to allow customers to withdraw cash from banks on Saturdays.
I wanted to develop a cash-issuing machine and, to make this a reality, I invented the PIN [personal identi cation number] and a coded token.
His machine didnt use plastic cards  instead, it used cheques containing carbon-14, a mildly radioactive substance.
It is widely accepted that the Shepherd-Barron ATM was the worlds  rst to be installed and used by the public; the  rst one, at a bank in north London, was opened on 27 June, 1967  a month before Goodfellows ATM appeared.
However, the patent for Goodfellows machine was lodged on 2 May, 1966, 14 months before Shepherd-Barrons ATM machine was first used.
That really stuck in my throat and I kicked up a fuss.
Shepherd-Barron is no longer alive but, in a 2005 interview, he was quite critical of his rival: I dont know him but its clear that the difference between Goodfellow and us was that we thought through the whole system concept and that was important to the banks who bought it.
The website ATMInventor.com says: Who invented the idea of an ATM?
We have to think it was James Goodfellow for holding a patent date of 1966. Who invented the ATM design we recognize today?
We think it was John D White in the US.
So after all these years, Goodfellow is  nally among a group of famous British inventors with John Logie Baird (the television), Alan Turing (the Turing machine), Sir Frank Whittle (the jet engine) and Sir Tim Berners-Lee (the World Wide Web).
Asked what he did with the 10 he received in the 1960s, Goodfellow says he thinks he blew it on a night out.
Our new international survey across 33 countries shows how wrong people around the world are about key social realities.
In Britain, people think that 43% of young adults aged 25-34 still live at home with their parents, rather than the actual 14%.
People also take mental shortcuts, where they take easily available information even if it doesnt quite  t the question.
Our study was mostly carried out through an online survey  and, in developing countries, this will be representative of a more wealthy, connected group rather than the general population.
What we  nd throughout the study is that people generalize from their own situations and forget how unrepresentative they are.
For Britain, worries are part of the explanation for peoples huge overestimates of how much the wealthiest own, how many young people are still living at home and what proportion of the population are immigrants (the guess is 25%, when it is really only 13%).
As part of his series, If Our Bodies Could Talk, Hamblin took on a no-showering challenge to examine the effect of over-cleansing the body.
He reduced the number of showers he had and did not use shampoo or soap when he had a shower.
Showering destroys these bacterial colonies; theyre completely destroyed by all our frequent rubbing and scrubbing.
And, when the bacteria washed off by soap return, they usually favour microbes which produce an odour  yes, showering too often may actually make you smell more.
However, when you stop showering and using soap, your skin goes through an initial (probably gross) adjustment period and, then, after that, the skin typically restores balance, oil production slows and healthy bacteria  ourish.
Reducing the frequency of showers (and the number of cleansing products used) has implications for our environment.
Thats 65 litres of clean, drinkable water that were  lling with soap and washing down the drain each day  sometimes more than once.
In a speech at the British Science Festival, Dr Paul Kelley of the Sleep and Circadian Neuroscience Institute at Oxford University said schools should stagger their starting times to work with the natural biological rhythms of their students.
In 2014, he published a paper in which he noted that, when children are around ten, their biological wake-up time is about 6.30am; at 16, this rises to 8am; and, at 18, someone you may think is just a lazy teenager actually has a natural waking hour of 9am.
The normal school starting time works for 10-year-olds but not for 16- to 18-year-olds.
A 7am alarm call for older teenagers, Kelley and his colleagues wrote in the paper, is the equivalent of a 4.30am start for a teacher in their 50s.
He says the solution is not to persuade teenagers to go to bed earlier.
Kelley says the working day should be more linked to our natural rhythms.
Should those in their 50s and above come in at 8am, while those in their 30s start at 10am and the teenage apprentice be encouraged to start at 11am?
Its very uplifting because its a solution that will make people less ill, and happier and better at what they do.
There would probably be fewer accidents because drivers would be more alert, he says.
It could mean the end of rush hour as people staggered their work and school-run times.
A later start to the day for many, says Kelley, is something that would bene t all people, particularly families.
The Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) will  nally have regulations on the commercial use of unmanned aircraft by June 2016.
But even short  ights from a mobile landing pad could cause serious logistical problems, he said.
Theyre not going to deliver from one uninhabited place to another uninhabited place; theyre going to deliver from a warehouse to the consumer, which will probably be an urban area or a suburban area, he said.
In those particular cases, there are going to be hazards that the vehicle is going to have to see.
Then, maybe theres construction equipment that wasnt there before but is there now.
Maybe GPS signals are blocked, in which case its going to have an incorrect idea about where it is.
Furthermore, you cant do everything with a 25kg aircraft, said Jay McConville, director of business development for unmanned systems at Lockheed Martin.
He is working on a program to allow drones to inspect infrastructure  pipelines, telephone lines, bridges and so on.
Weve developed an exploration algorithm where you draw a box around an area and it will  y around that area and look at every surface and then report back.
If you  y commercial airlines, they often say, Oh, a component has failed  we have to go back to the gate, Singh said.
Part of the solution, Singh said, is planning for every situation: If things fail, the vehicle has to do something reasonable.   
Maria is sitting on a black plastic chair in a community centre on a cold Tuesday afternoon waiting for someone to call her number.
When its her turn, Maria goes to pick up a brown paper bag  lled with essentials including pasta, eggs and corn akes, and can choose between butternut squash or carrots as this weeks vegetables.
Maria is the 34th client so far today at East Hampton Food Pantry, just streets away from some of the most expensive houses in the world.
The Hamptons are historic oceanfront towns and villages 100 miles from Manhattan.
The people who come here are rich and famous but we who live here are not, says Maria, who works 14-hour days in the summer cleaning mansions but often has no work at all in the winter.
She says some families with up to  ve children have to live in basements and still pay more than $1,000 a month in rent.
Lots of her friends cant pay for heating or medication and many would go hungry if the East Hampton Food Pantry didnt exist, she says.
Vicki Littman is chairperson of the East Hampton Food Pantry, which provided more than 31,000 food parcels in 2015.
Housing is the biggest cost in the Hamptons.
Cantwell says more than half the towns homes are empty for most of the year  this causes the population to go from 80,000 in August to 10,000 in the winter months.
Youve got to remember that this community used to be a farming and  shing community of people who lived off the land and the water  a real working-class community.
Its hard to grasp  OK, the summer is ending.
Vallone, who works cleaning pools and doing odd jobs on luxury estates, says that, if he saves well, his summer earnings can last until November.
There are worse things to do in life than stroll along Rios Copacabana beach in the sunshine on the way to watch a World Cup match, so it was perhaps not surprising that England fan Anthony McDowell from Liverpool was in a good mood.
He and half a dozen friends are among the thousands of supporters from around the world who have made the beach into a party zone of national colours and chants.
Some danced, some posed for photos, some drank, but mostly they just walked and talked football, waiting for the next game to begin on the nearby big screen.
The cheerful, largely peaceful mood was very different from the protests, transport chaos and stadium problems during the preparations for the World Cup.
But, now the football is under way, visiting supporters are determined to enjoy the experience.
The trip has not been without its problems.
And, they have been surprised that many bars do not have big screens for the games.
But, like many fans, they said they loved the atmosphere of this tournament, which has got off to a spectacular start on the pitch.
Everyone must have been thrilled by Robin van Persies extraordinary diving header for the Netherlands against Spain.
And, there have been lots of goals: 28 in the  rst eight games  almost three times as many as at the same stage in South Africa in 2010.
The Globo newspaper listed a number of problems in the 12 host cities.
The worst transport problems were in Natal, where bus drivers were on strike.
But, protests have diminished since the opening day, when small demonstrations took place in several cities and police used tear gas and pepper spray.
The tournament has made only a small mark on Sa_o Paulo, South Americas most populous city, but far away in Manaus  the remote Amazonian city where England played Italy  visitors said there was World Cup fever with brightly decorated streets and  ags on many cars.
But we were in Sao Paulo for four or  ve days before the opening match and you wouldnt have known until the last day that there was even a World Cup on.
McDonalds is the worlds biggest burger chain and a global emblem of American consumer capitalism.
McDonalds has revealed that worldwide sales dropped by 3.3% from 2013.
In Europe, sales are down by 4%, mostly because of problems in Ukraine and the anti-western mood in Russia.
But it is in the US, where McDonalds has around 40% of its restaurants, where the crisis is deepest.
Almost 60 years since Ray Kroc opened his  rst restaurant in Des Plaines, Illinois, consumers are losing their appetite for a Big Mac and fries.
McDonalds has seen 12 straight months of falling sales in its massive home market, with sales down 4.1% in the latest quarter.
The number of 19-to-21-year-olds visiting McDonalds once a month has fallen by 13% since 2011.
McDonalds is also widely perceived as less healthy than most of its rivals, especially Chipotle, with its antibiotic-free meat and locally sourced, seasonal produce  although local can mean 350 miles away.
was one question on the Our Food Your Questions website  this refers to the controversial beef  ller used for dog food that is sprayed with ammonia to make it  t for human consumption.
Yet, just as McDonalds has been losing the customers who will pay a bit more for food they think is fresher and healthier, it has also lost its edge in fast-food essentials: speedy service at low prices.
The expensive tag was unjusti ed, said Mary Chapman at food analysts Technomic.
A competitive breakfast menu, improved coffee and free wi-  have given McDonalds a broad appeal in the UK, said consultant Peter Martin, adding that 56% of British adults have visited a McDonalds restaurant at least once in the last six months.
Executives are promising to fight misconceptions about its food in its home market.
Only four out of McDonalds 14,000 US restaurants had so far tested build your own burger, he said.
Meanwhile, despite the declining sales, the chain continues to expand globally: by the end of 2014, it expects to have 1,400 new restaurants.
We think it will be number one for not just years but decades to come.   
The catching and killing of sharks longer than three metres began after what the state government called an unprecedented number of shark attacks on Western Australias coast.
Kate Faehrmann, of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, said from a protest in the state capital, Perth: Weve always said that this policy wont work.
This has demonstrated something about the national psyche; that, despite all the fear, thousands of people are coming out across the country to say, Thats their ocean.
Anthony Joyce, a surfer who once had his foot caught in a sharks mouth, said: The number of sharks they are going to kill is going to make no difference.
The state government has refused to say how many sharks have been killed, though there have been reports of sharks smaller than three metres being released after getting caught on drumlines,  oating drums  xed to the sea bed with bait hanging on hooks underneath them.
Conservationists say there is no evidence the cull will reduce the number of shark attacks on humans, because no previous cull has only used drumlines.
Researchers at the University of Western Australia say the increased number of shark attacks in the state is probably because the state has the fastest-growing population in Australia, not because of a rising number of sharks.
Richard Peirce, of the UK-based conservation charity, the Shark Trust, said that the cull would be ineffective and could bring more predators towards the coast.
People often dont consider that that drumlines are indiscriminate  even if monitored through the day, leaving the lines in at night has the potential to attract other predators into the area, attracted by those sharks and other species hooked and injured.
Worldwide, in 2012, there were 80 attacks by sharks, seven of which were fatal, compared to nearly 100m sharks killed by humans each year.
RSPCA Australia said in a statement that it believes the cull is unjusti ed.
Instead, it is consistent with a changing population and human behaviour; that is, there are greater numbers of people in the water, it said.
Youre advertising a problem that doesnt exist in a major way and youre deterring people from coming to Perth and your beautiful countryside around it.
What the job involves: A race engineer is the interpreter between the race-car mechanics and the driver, says race engineer Jamie Muir.
The engineer takes feedback from the driver, analyses the data and makes decisions about the set-up needed for maximum performance, then passes this on to the mechanics.
Ethical hacker Typical salary: A newly quali ed hacker can expect a minimum salary of 35,000 to 50,000.
What the job involves: A company will pay an ethical hacker to hack into its computer system to see how well it might resist a real attack.
What the job involves: Descending to the sea bed and searching for unexploded bombs, shells, grenades and landmines, then either safely recovering and collecting the weapons or securely disposing of them.
Quali cations: To dive offshore, you must have diving quali cations.
To be able to dispose of the bombs safely, youll also need an explosive- disposal quali cation and years of experience.
The job: Companies pay a social engineer to try to trick employees into giving them con dential information that allows the engineer to access sensitive company data or the companys computer network.
Quali cations: A private-helicopter-pilot licence, a commercial pilots licence and around 2,000 hours of experience  ying at low levels.
To succeed as a power line helicopter pilot, you need ... a steady hand and a cool head.
Butlers also suffer from isolation, cultural differences with their employer and having to work for people who arent always nice. 
Employees on zero-hours contracts often get no holiday or sick pay and have to ask permission before looking for additional work elsewhere.
And this needs to consider both the advantages and disadvantages for businesses and employees.
Retailer Sports Direct recently became the focus of controversy on zero-hours when it was reported that the company employs around 20,000 of its 23,000 staff on the contracts.
The retailers use of the contracts was followed by details of many other companies using the contracts, including cinema chain Cineworld and Buckingham Palace, which uses them for its 350 summer workers.
Pub group J D Wetherspoon has 24,000 of its staff  80% of its workforce  on zero-hours contracts.
Vidhya Alakeson, from the Resolution Foundation, added: If its true that there are around one million people on zero-hours contracts, then that would be a substantial portion of the workforce  this could no longer be dismissed as an issue affecting only a tiny minority.
Unions and poverty campaign groups have accused employers of pressuring staff into signing the contracts so that they can avoid their responsibilities and reduce staff bene ts.
They may give  exibility to a few, but the contracts favour the employers and make it hard for workers to complain.
Workers on zero-hours contracts are often only told how many hours they will work when weekly or monthly rotas are created, but are expected to be on call for extra work at short notice.
We believe zero-hours contracts are essential in our organization, as we are very weather-dependent, a spokeswoman said.
Its important to be able to reorganize staff rotas quickly to respond to the weather and zero-hours contracts allow us to do this.
Figures from the poll suggest that 17% of employers in the private sector use zero-hours contracts, considerably lower than the 34% of organizations in the voluntary sector and 24% in the public sector.
Industries where employers were most likely to have at least one person on a zero-hours contract were hotels, catering and leisure (48%), education (35%) and healthcare (27%).
