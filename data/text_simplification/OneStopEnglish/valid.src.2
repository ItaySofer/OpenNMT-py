They may not know who Steve Jobs was or even how to tie their own shoelaces, but the average six-year-old child understands more about digital technology than a 45-year-old adult, according to an authoritative new report.
The advent of broadband in the year 2000 has created a generation of digital natives, Ofcom (which checks standards in the UK communications industries) says in its annual study of British consumers.
As a result of growing up in the digital age, they are developing fundamentally different communication habits from older generations, even compared to what we call the early adopters, the 16-to-24 age group.
Ofcom devised a digital quotient, or DQ, test to put 800 children and 2,000 adults through their paces, which, rather than measuring intelligence, as an IQ test would, attempts to gauge awareness of and self-con dence around gadgets from tablets to smart watches, knowledge of superfast internet, 4G mobile- phone networks and mobile apps.
Digital understanding peaks between 14 and 15 years of age, when the average is a DQ of 113, and then drops gradually throughout adulthood, before falling rapidly in old age.
The ways in which millennial children contact each other and consume entertainment are so different from previous generations that forecasters now consider their preferences a better indication of the future than those of trendsetting young adults.
Two decades ago, teenagers devoted their evenings to monopolizing the home telephone line, dissecting love affairs and friendships in conversations that lasted for hours.
Just 2% of childrens time is spent emailing, compared to 33% for adults.
They spend 20% of their time viewing short video clips, for example on YouTube, or news clips distributed via Facebook and other social sites.
Young adults aged 16 to 24 are voracious consumers of almost all media.
They call him the Robin Hood of the banks, a man who took out dozens of loans, worth almost half a million euros, with no intention of ever paying them back.
Instead, Enric Duran handed the money out to projects that created and promoted alternatives to capitalism.
After 14 months in hiding, Duran is unapologetic, even though his activities could land him in jail.
Im proud of what I did, he said in an interview by Skype from an undisclosed location.
Meanwhile, our reliance on perpetual growth was creating a system that created money out of nothing.
He spent two months in prison before being bailed for 50,000.
His actions, he said, were in the vanguard of a worldwide debate on the economic crisis.
In his case, he said, the element of reciprocity he could offer to banks might lie in the insight he gleaned from years of obtaining bank loans fraudulently.
More than 25,000 kilos of dead  sh were collected in the aftermath and nearly 2,000 adult birds, chicks, eggs and nests were killed or destroyed.
Suddenly aware of Donanas status as the nations most important natural site, Spain decided to spend a further 360m, some of it EU money, on restoring the landscape, which, in the 1950s and 60s, had been drained in places to create rice and cotton  elds.
However, the real body blow for conservationists has been the recent decision of the Andalucian government to reopen the Frailes mine that so very nearly destroyed Donana in 1998.
Donana already faces a great number of threats, but now they want to bring back the very cause of its near-undoing 16 years ago.
The crash of Spains banks in 2008 hit the region catastrophically and unemployment in some parts of Andalucia is now more than 30%.
Reopening the mine would provide more than 1,000 precious jobs.
"There are riches here, riches that are badly needed by local inhabitants, said Vicente Fernandez Guerrero, secretary-general of Innovation, Industry and Energy for Andalucia.
People have been digging metals and ores here since Roman times, after all.
More to the point, added Fernandez, the mine licence would stipulate that only modern mining techniques, which avoid the creation of poisonous wet waste, would be allowed.
The proposal has some support in the area, but it also has a lot of opposition.
For his part, Carlos Davila, who works for the Spanish Ornithological Society in Donana, was also alarmed at the proposal.
This is a very, very bad idea indeed, he told me.
Nor should this be surprising, for this is a truly special place.
The trouble is that Spain does not have the public resources it possessed 16 years ago.
This point is backed by Davila.
After the disaster, Spain woke up to the fact that it possessed a place of real ecological importance and did a lot to clean it up and protect it, he added.
That movie will outline a rebel mission to steal the plans of the Death Star, a key plot element of the  rst  lm in 1977.
In creating a multi-stranded, multi-character cinema universe around Star Wars, Lucas lm-Disney are taking their cue from the phenomenally successful series of  lms produced by Marvel Studios, which Disney also acquired, in 2009.
Disney has brought a whole new level of marketing savvy to an already popular product: Dergarabedian cites the decision to make all six existing Star Wars  lms available on streaming services as a brilliant way to build the anticipation for the new  lm and reinvigorate the idea of Star Wars in the minds of the fans.
Michael Rosser, news editor for Screen International, suggests that it is this shared universe of highly infectious nostalgia that keeps Star Wars in pole position among  lm franchises.
Rosser is referring to the three  lms Lucas directed between 1999 and 2005  The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith  which chronicled the life of Luke Skywalkers father, Anakin, who transforms into Darth Vader.
It shows the power of Star Wars that, although they were disappointing, the prequels still managed to make a lot of money, said Rosser.
They are also trying to bring people into the cinema at a time when lots are staying home for entertainment.
Meanwhile, Dergarabedian is anticipating massive business when The Force Awakens reaches cinemas in December 2015.
We are certainly looking at a record opening for December and it should go on to make at least a billion dollars worldwide.
We may not yet be living in an age of  ying cars, as predicted in the 1985  lm Back to the Future II, but the rise of smartphones and other new technologies is creating a reality that is arguably as exciting and almost as far-fetched.
Experts agree that economic and demographic changes, technological advances, and environmental concerns are fundamentally altering the transportation landscape.
Theres a focus on a tighter connection between the role of transportation and the economic health of cities and its impact on people.
Connectivity The rise of ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft  essentially taxis booked at the click of a smartphone button  and apps like Waze, which uses real-time traf c data to  nd the quickest routes for drivers, are dramatically changing how people get around and affecting the very way in which traf c moves through a city.
Meanwhile, those still driving cars are dealing with less traf c thanks to Waze.
Companies are working to develop technology that will enable a vehicle to tell traf c control systems not only that it is present but also where it is going and how fast it is travelling.
But, even if driverless technology were ready to hit the roads now, it would take a long time to get fully automated given the average age of cars on the road is 11.5 years old.
DNA taken from the wisdom tooth of a European hunter-gatherer has given scientists an unprecedented glimpse of modern humans before the rise of farming.
He was probably lactose intolerant and had more difficulty digesting starchy foods than the farmers who transformed diets and lifestyles when they took up tools in the first agricultural revolution.
But scientists may have overestimated the impact farming had in shaping the human immune system, because tests on the hunter-gatherers DNA found that he already carried mutations that boost the immune system to tackle various nasty bugs.
The Spanish team started their work after a group of cavers stumbled upon two skeletons in a deep and complex cave system high up in the Cantabrian Mountains of northwest Spain in 2006.
Carbon dating put the remains at around 7,000 years old, before farming had swept into Europe from the Middle East.
It is the first time researchers have obtained the complete genome of a modern European who lived before the Neolithic revolution.
The results suggest that blue eye colour came first in Europe, with the transition to lighter skin ongoing through Mesolithic times.
You never see a reconstruction of a Mesolithic hunter-gatherer with dark skin and blue eye colour, Lalueza-Fox said.
The Spanish team went on to compare the genome of the hunter-gatherer to those of modern Europeans from different regions to see how they might be related.
Martin Jones, professor of archaeological science at Cambridge University, said the immunity genes were the most striking result.
Two mothers in South Africa have discovered they are raising each others daughters after they were mistakenly switched at birth in a hospital in 2010.
But, while one of the women wants to correct the error and reclaim her biological child, the other is refusing to give back the girl she has raised as her own, posing a huge legal dilemma.
Henk Strydom, a lawyer for one of the mothers, who cannot be identified because of a court order, described the inadvertent swap as a travesty and tragedy that is unlikely to have a happy ending.
Strydom continued: The man denied he was the father.
Strydom said of his client: She said there are resemblances to herself.
The woman reportedly became unhappy with the process and approached the childrens court in a bid to gain custody of her biological child, but the other mother refused.
Its four years later: you can understand she doesnt want to give up her baby.
The High Court in Pretoria has appointed the University of Pretorias Centre for Child Law to investigate what will now be in the best interests of the children, which is the guiding principle under South African law.
He said at this point, he and his client do not want to sue the hospital or government health department, which is currently helping with the case and providing counselling.
The children and mothers will undergo full and thorough clinical assessments and may be seen by a psychologist.
It is not the first child-swap case to come to light in South Africa.
He grew up on welfare and became a truck driver, whereas his biological siblings  and the boy brought up in his place  attended private secondary schools and universities.
From glow-in-the-dark trees to underground bike sheds and solar-powered bins, we look at some of the more left eld solutions to help make our cities more livable.
City living has many upsides but a sustainable lifestyle is increasingly not among them.
Pollution, traf c and loss of green spaces are just some of the daily trials that city-dwellers have to deal with.
Take an empty car park, a pocketful of change and a pot plant or two, and make yourself your own private park.
Subterranean storage Not all urban dwellers are hooked to the car.
At just seven metres wide, the cylindrical storage facility buries deep enough into the ground to house 204 bikes.
Glow-in-the-dark trees When most people think of trees that glow in the dark, Christmas baubles and fallen pine needles usually come to mind.

Agios Efstratios is so remote, so forgotten by the banks, the government and most of the modern world that the mobile phone network cant process data and there isnt a single ATM or credit-card machine on the island.
Residents have been forced to make nine-hour round trips to the nearest big island to get cash and Greek visitors say they cant get together enough money to come.
Tourist numbers are down 80% this year, said Mayor Maria Kakali, in an of ce in the village where she grew up, home to around 200 people.
Kakali has badgered the government and a major Greek bank into promising an ATM within weeks but she still feels it may come too late for this season on an island where tourism dwarfs the two other sources of income:  shing and agriculture: We have almost no reservations in August, when usually we have people calling us up asking to  nd a room and we cant help them.
Everything, even milk or bread, has changed hands three or four times before it gets to us and each middleman has to take a pro t, said Provatas Costas, a 58-year-old  sherman.
Lemnos has dozens of wild beaches, where even at the height of summer you can swim and sunbathe virtually alone, a small nightlife scene and numerous cultural sites.
If taxes go up, even more young people will leave, warns Mayor Kakali, who has devoted her year in of ce to improving education on the island to help keep it an attractive place for families.

What is going to happen is a growth in events where it isnt just music but, like this one, with poetry or books or magic shows.
There will be lots of small combination festivals that give something extra  not people standing around in a massive great  eld unable to go to the toilet because they might miss the band.
People dont seem to want to listen to a body of work, an album, any more.
And, most rock bands built a reputation on a body of work  they might take three albums to really hone their art, to become great, but young people dont want that.
Goldsmith, 69, also revealed that he has teamed up with Robin de Levita, the Dutch producer of the Whos 1970s rock musical Tommy, at a new 1,100-seat theatre in Wembley, which is due to be  nished in time for the  rst stage adaptation of the phenomenally successful teen book and movie series The Hunger Games in June 2016.

There are far greater numbers of southern white rhinos and black rhinos.
From 2007, when just 13 rhinos were killed by poachers in South Africa, the killings have grown horri cally.
In 2014, 1,215 rhinos were slaughtered for their horns in South Africa.
As colourful  sh were swimming past him off the Greek coast, Cathal Redmond was convinced he had taken some great photos with his  rst underwater camera.
Having taken the pictures while holding his breath underwater, he blamed the limited time he had to set up the shots.
He vowed to make the little extra time needed a reality and the result is his invention of the Express Dive  a re llable air storage device, held in the mouth, that lets users swim underwater for two minutes.
So, rather than just get in underwater and spend 30 seconds holding their breath, I wanted to do a little bit more than they were able to do, says Redmond, 27.
The real problem is that it is very limiting as to what you can do.
It was during a  nal-year project for his product design degree at the University of Limerick that Redmond produced the Express Dive.
When above the surface, the unit uses a fan to suck in air via a vent in the mouthpiece.
When air is no longer being taken in, the vent shuts off and, as the user dives, air is fed back via the mouthpiece.
The device can take in enough air for two minutes of diving and takes approximately the same amount of time to be re lled.
He likens it to an extension of the lungs in that the user is taking a deep breath and then using it underwater.
It is an extension of the bodys capacity to store air, he says.
Redmond says he has shown that the motor can compress two minutes worth of air into the unit and that the design can be effectively held in the divers mouth.
But, with enough testing, Redmond is con dent he can get a fully functioning device that will not endanger swimmers underwater.
To anyone who thinks two minutes of air is no more than a minor improvement on snorkelling, Redmond says it could make all the difference underwater.
She last deactivated her account in December 2015 after  nding the amount of personal information shared by others too heavy to deal with on top of her work demands.
A lot of my job is listening to peoples lives all day, every day and it started to feel so overwhelming to go on social media and see every single detail of everybodys life, including people that I dont really have a relationship with, she said.
She added: Im holding a lot in my work life for people and sometimes it felt like it was too heavy to do in my personal life also.
Mathias, who works for the Baltimore City government, had Facebook and Twitter accounts for years before deleting them both in November 2012.

His billing, The Beale Street Blues Boy, was shortened to Blues Boy King and thence to BB.
He was always ready to praise the musicians who had in uenced him and would usually mention T-Bone Walker first.
He once explained that his guitar technique was partly based on his lack of skill: I started to bend notes because I could never play in the bottleneck style, like Elmore James and Booker White.
The 1965 album Live at the Regal, however, proved the durability of Kings blues repertoire and has become iconic, a turning point in the early listening of many younger musicians.
He had further R&B hits with blues numbers including How Blue Can You Get and Paying the Cost to Be the Boss, and, in 1969, he hit the upper reaches of the pop charts  where no blues artist had been for many years  with The Thrill Is Gone.
About a year and a half ago, he said in 1969, all of a sudden, kids started coming up to me saying, Youre the greatest blues guitarist in the world.
Guided by his manager, Sidney Seidenberg, he embarked on international concert tours that took him to Japan, Australia, China and Russia.
He also gave concerts to prisoners at the Cook County jail in Chicago and at San Quentin, experiences that led to his long involvement in rehabilitation programmes.
In 1990, King was diagnosed with diabetes and cut back his touring but not so much that his followers outside the US could not catch up with him every year or two.
The celebrations for his 80th birthday, in 2005, included an award-winning album of collaborations with Clapton, Mark Knop er, Roger Daltrey, Gloria Estefan and others, tributes from musicians as diverse as Bono, Amadou Bagayoko and Elton John, and a farewell tour that proved not to be a farewell at all.
Statistics suggest that vaping among smokers and recent ex-smokers, who comprise the vast majority of vapers, may already be on the decline.
Figures released in 2014 by the health charity Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) reveal that usage among adults in Britain of electronic cigarettes  which do not contain tobacco and produce vapour, not smoke  tripled from an estimated 700,000 users in 2012 to 2.1 million in 2014.
However,  gures collated by the Smoking Toolkit Study, a research body backed by the Department of Health that provides quarterly updates on smoking trends, show vapings appeal may be waning.
The drop is described as statistically signi cant by Professor Robert West, of UCLs Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, who collates the  gures for the Toolkit.
Smokers are the key group for e-cigarette  rms because seven out of ten vapers are smokers.
Weve only been tracking vaping for just over a year, so its a short time period, but we are not seeing growth in the number of long-term ex-smokers or never smokers using e-cigarettes.
That is not to say vaping rates might not change but, at this stage, it looks like theyre staying the same.
The levelling off in popularity of vaping in the UK would appear to be at odds with what is happening in the US, where the technology has been promoted aggressively and where recent reports suggested it was growing in popularity.
Instead, e-cigarettes seem to be most popular among adults seeking to quit.
While the  gures published this month by Smoking In England show that the use of electronic cigarettes by smokers has levelled off, their data also shows the huge increase in use since May 2011, said James Dunworth, director and co-founder of ecigarettedirect.co.uk.
E-cigarettes are behaving like a souped-up nicotine patch, West agreed.
It emerged recently that the European Commission (EC) is looking at increasing taxes on e-cigarettes, something that could have an impact on their popularity.
This may mean vapers will have to increase their usage to obtain the same hit, again something that may make e-cigarettes more expensive.
West suggested that policymakers should see e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation aid and not subject them to the same regulations as smoking.
It just sounds like youre having a go at vapers and hitting everyone with a sledgehammer and that undermines the public health messages were trying to get out.
Vienna is the worlds best city to live in, Baghdad is the worst and London, Paris and New York do not even make it into the top 35, according to international research into quality of life.
Viennese-born Helena Hartlauer, 32, said she was not surprised at her citys top position.
The municipalitys social democratic government has a long tradition of investing in high-quality social housing, making Vienna almost uniquely affordable among major cities.
I live in a 100sq-metre turn-of-the-century apartment in a good area about 20 minutes walk from the city centre.
An equivalent apartment in London would cost upwards of 2,000 and even more in New York, ranked 44th in the table.
You dont realize how safe Vienna is until you head abroad, said Hartlauer.
Vienna bene ted enormously from the fall of the Berlin Wall, becoming the gateway to Eastern European countries that often have historic ties to the former Austro-Hungarian empire.
Our big USP is our geographical location, said Martin Eichtinger, Austrian ambassdaor to London, who lived in Vienna for 20 years.
The fall of the Berlin Wall helped de ne Vienna as the hub for companies wanting to do business in Central Europe.
According to the World Bank, Austria has one of the highest  gures for GDP per head in the world, just behind the US and ahead of Germany and Britain, although quite some way below neighbouring Switzerland.
Zurich in Switzerland is named by Mercer as having the worlds second highest quality of life but the Viennese say their city is far more fun.
Its a very fast growing, young and lively city, she added  though she conceded she works for the citys tourist board.
But, after an increase in budget  ights from regional British cities such as Manchester and Edinburgh, Vienna is fast catching up as a popular destination.
Vienna has ranked top in the last seven published rankings, said Mercer.
It scores highly in a number of categories; it provides a safe and stable environment to live in, a high level of public utilities and transport facilities and good recreational facilities.
Paris remained stable for several years but has, this year, dropped ten places in the overall ranking, said Mercer.
Australian cities also perform very highly in the survey, with Sydney 10th and Melbourne 15th.
All restaurants should have to publicly state their exact tipping procedure.
Elle, 22, Edinburgh: We never know whether its fair Average tips: 20 per eight-hour shift I think they treat waiters best in ... France  I work three jobs, all on part-time zero-hours contracts, in catering and hospitality.
In restaurants, because a lot of customers add tips through card payments, the staff never actually see how much is getting tipped  so we dont know whether were getting our fair share or not.
The system seems better in France, where they dont tip much but waiting tables is seen as a proper job, offering job security and a decent income.
Equally, when a member of the team does incredibly well, they dont get what theyve earned.
The managers should have ways to pay for broken glasses and plates without docking our tips.
I make around 20 a shift but would only be given 10-15 of that money.
Id rather we earned a good basic wage (like in Australia) and therefore didnt have to rely on tips to make ends meet.
Tom, Manchester: A big night of tips can help pay the rent Average tips: 40 per eight-hour shift I think they treat waiters best in ... Italy  Where I used to work,  oor staff kept 80% of cash tips and 40% of card tips.
The other 20% of cash went into a pot for the commis waiters and service bar.
Its hard to say how much I earned a shift; maybe around 40, 20 from card tips.
They have got tipping right in Italy, where people dont add a service charge but usually round up their bill so, if they get a meal for 19, they leave a 20 note and dont ask for change.

Professor Robin Dunbar is famous for his research that suggests a person can only have roughly 150 people as a social group.
An overwhelming majority of 91% post a photo of themselves, 71% post the city or town where they live, up from 61%, more than half give email addresses and a  fth give their phone number.
More than 80% list their interests, allowing brands to target them most effectively.
But most younger users do restrict their pro les, with 60% allowing friends only.

4 Facebook has been the tool to organize revolutions Though the Arab Spring was dubbed the Twitter revolution, organizing demonstrations and direct action has been revolutionized by Facebook.
Manchester Universitys Olga Onuch found Facebook had been the key medium for reaching half of all the Euromaidan protesters in Ukraine.
Many of those interviewed in Onuchs research said they relied on Facebook for the truth about what was happening  unable to trust traditional media.
For better or (often) worse, it is a directory to  nd, contact and glean information for almost any ordinary person, who might suddenly  nd themselves at the centre of the days biggest news story.

Each year, 1.3bn tonnes of food, about a third of all that is produced, is wasted, including about 45% of all fruit and vegetables, 35% of  sh and seafood, 30% of cereals, 20% of dairy products and 20% of meat.
Estimates suggest that, by 2050, food production will need to have increased by 60% on 2005 levels to feed a growing global population.
The problem is global but manifests itself in very different ways.
In wealthy countries, there are low levels of unintentional losses but high levels of food waste, which involves food being thrown away by consumers because they have purchased too much or by retailers who reject food because of strict aesthetic standards.
The carbon footprint of food produced and not eaten is estimated at 3.3 gigatonnes of CO2, meaning that, if food waste were a country, it would rank as the third highest national emitter of greenhouse gases after the US and China.
About 1.4bn hectares, or close to 30% of available agricultural land, is used to grow or farm food that is subsequently wasted.
And more surface and groundwater, or blue water, is used to produce wasted food around the globe than is used for agriculture by any single country, including India and China.
