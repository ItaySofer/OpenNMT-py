The team, led by Professor Carlo Leifert at Newcastle University, concludes that there are statistically signi cant, meaningful differences, with a range of antioxidants being substantially higher  between 19% and 69%  in organic food.
It is the  rst study to demonstrate clear and wide-ranging differences between organic and conventional fruits, vegetables and cereals.
The researchers say the increased levels of antioxidants are equivalent to one to two of the  ve portions of fruits and vegetables recommended to be consumed daily and would therefore be signi cant and meaningful in terms of human nutrition, if information linking these compounds to the health bene ts associated with increased fruit, vegetable and wholegrain consumption is con rmed.
The  ndings will add to the controversy over organic food and whether it is better for people, with one expert saying that the  ndings were exaggerated.
Leifert has had a lot of disagreements with a lot of people.
The results of the research are based on an analysis of 343 peer-reviewed studies from around the world  more than ever before  which examine differences between organic and conventional fruit, vegetables and cereals.
Also, the higher levels of cadmium and pesticides in conventional produce were still well below regulatory limits.
A further criticism is that the differences seen may result from different climates, soil types and crop varieties, and not from organic farming, though the researchers argue that combining many studies should average out these other differences.
The greatest criticism, however, will be over the suggestions of potential health bene ts.
The most recent major analysis, which took in 223 studies in 2012, found little evidence.
This was also the conclusion of earlier, smaller studies published in 2009 in a scienti c journal and by the UK Food Standards Agency, though the latter considered just 11 studies.
Opinion polls show healthy eating (55%) and avoiding chemical residues (53%) are key reasons cited by shoppers for buying organic produce.
Browning said: This research backs up what people think about organic food.
In other countries, there have long been much higher levels of support and acceptance of the bene ts of organic food and farming.
To a master traditional navigator like Tua Pittman from Raratonga in the Cook Islands, a canoe is much more than just a means of transport.
An island is our canoe, the community are the crew members and the politicians and leaders are the navigators.
On a canoe, you are not just going from one destination to another using the stars, the moon, the sun and the birds.
It has been a whirlwind week for the crews of the  otilla of four sailing canoes since arriving in Sydney for the start of the World Parks Congress.
Around 100 crew members were involved in the various stages of the voyage and they aimed to travel using only traditional navigation techniques.
Unfortunately, said Tua, the crews were forced to rely on modern navigation equipment on some occasions to reach Australia in time for the Congress.
The of cial title of the expedition is the Mua Voyage and it is a partnership between the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Oceania Regional Of ce and  ve Paci c Island countries: Samoa, Tonga, New Zealand, the Cook Islands and Fiji.
Our coral reefs, the greatest in the world, and our mangrove and wetland spawning grounds are disappearing.
Growing global populations and the relentless pursuit of unsustainable development are reducing the ability of our ocean to sustain life.
According to the IUCN, as of 2013, the amount of the worlds oceans in marine protected areas was not even three per cent and less than one per cent of that is no take.
This was despite a target of 20-30% no-take areas set by the last World Parks Congress held in South Africa in 2003.
World-leading marine scientist Professor Callum Roberts from the University of York was one of the scientists who helped set the 20-30% target in 2003.
After dif cult negotiations, the World Parks Congress delegates passed a motion that will dramatically shift the goals for global marine management.
Its just like a huge reward for all the effort that we made to be here and to be heard.
He also said that pollution was worsening, particularly as the canoes approached big cities such as Sydney.
And the effects of climate change were already beginning to impact seriously on Paci c Islanders.
The decisions of the big countries have twice, thrice, four times the impact on the small countries than on developed, large nations.
PizzaExpress branches are to be targeted by protesters as part of an attempt to get the restaurant chain to stop creaming off a proportion of tips for staff that have been paid on credit and debit cards.
Campaigners have also started an online petition in the hope that restaurant-goers will back their demands.
In a policy that has outraged some employees, PizzaExpress keeps, as an admin fee, 8p out of every 1 paid when tips are given by card.
The chain, which has 430 branches around the UK and is particularly popular with families, makes an estimated 1m a year from the practice, according to the union Unite.
We believe this 8% fee is unfair and that, if the chain values its staff, it should be paying them the total tips they are given by customers, said Chantal Chegrinec, campaigns of cer at Unite.
We are starting with PizzaExpress but they are by no means the only offender and we will be turning our attention to other companies after this.
The protests are being organized by local branches of Unite, with the  rst taking place at the British Museum branch of PizzaExpress in London.
The union has also written to the restaurant chains CEO, Richard Hodgson.
So you see my colleagues and I are heavily reliant on customer tips to top up our low wages.
PizzaExpress joins restaurant chains Ask and Zizzi in siphoning off 8% of the tips paid by card but other chains deduct even more.
Cafe_ Rouge, Bella Italia and Belgo deduct 10%, as do Strada and Giraffe, which is owned by Tesco.
A spokesperson for PizzaExpress said that its admin charge was to cover the cost of running a tronc  a standard pay arrangement used to distribute tips among staff.
The Restaurant Group, which owns Frankie & Bennys, Chiquitos and Garfunkels, used to charge 10% but dropped this policy several years ago.
PizzaExpress says the charge is mentioned in small print at the bottom of its menus but the employee who wrote to Unite said that, when she mentioned the charge to customers, it always came as a surprise.
Most would then pay the tip in cash.
Almost 6,000 people have so far signed Unites online petition.
I work in a busy London branch and, on an average night, Ill serve 150 people and take home 40 to 50 in tips, he says.
That might sound like a lot but that money is crucial to me as my basic pay is only 6.50 an hour.
The research indicates that fewer clouds form as the planet warms, meaning less sunlight is reflected back into space, driving temperatures up further still.
The way clouds affect global warming has been the biggest mystery surrounding future climate change.
4C would likely be catastrophic rather than simply dangerous, Sherwood said.
The research is a big advance that halves the uncertainty about how much warming is caused by rises in carbon emissions, according to scientists commenting on the study, published in the journal Nature.
Hideo Shiogama and Tomoo Ogura, at Japans National Institute for Environmental Studies, said the explanation of how fewer clouds form as the world warms was convincing and agreed this indicated future climate change would be greater than expected.
Scientists measure the sensitivity of the Earths climate to greenhouse gases by estimating the temperature rise that would be caused by a doubling of CO2 in the atmosphere compared with pre-industrial levels  as is likely to happen within 50 years, on current trends.
The key was to ensure that the way clouds form in the real world was accurately represented in computer climate models, which are the only tool researchers have to predict future temperatures.
Furthermore, a study in November 2013 suggested the pause may be largely an illusion resulting from the lack of temperature readings from polar regions, where warming is greatest.
Sherwood accepts his teams work on the role of clouds cannot definitively rule out that future temperature rises will lie at the lower end of projections.
Drawing on household panel surveys, the report found that, in parts of rural Kenya and in South Africa, 30 to 40% of those who escaped from poverty fell back, rising to 60% in some areas of Ethiopia between 1999 and 2009.
Even in successful countries such as Indonesia and Vietnam, the proportion has been 20%.
Lovemore, 74, from Zimbabwe, has become one of the poorest people in his village.
He recently lost his job as a car-park attendant due to ill health and had to take in his  ve grandchildren after the death of his daughters.
The big gains in China are unlikely to be matched by similar progress elsewhere, while climate-related shocks and deep poverty in parts of sub-Saharan Africa will slow momentum.
The report calls for a shift in thinking about poverty to focus on the chronically poor  those who are poor for many years or their entire lives  and for more emphasis on stopping impoverishment, the descent into poverty.
The report says progress on poverty reduction, while impressive to date, has had less of an impact on the chronically poor than on those who were already closer to the poverty line.
The  rst is social assistance  a safety net  to bring the poorest people closer to a decent standard of living.
The third is pro-poorest economic growth policies to ensure that the bene ts of increasing national prosperity reach the very poorest people.
Even Nigeria, with its oil wealth, spends only $650 per capita, Shepherd said.
The authors urge governments to develop an inclusive national development plan and to work with civil society to ensure the poorest people are represented politically as well as tackling dif cult social norms such as dowries and witchcraft that contribute to extreme poverty: This often means challenging and, perhaps, sweeping away aspects of the status quo and represents the most marked departure from business as usual. 
Now Singerer, a childminder, has joined FemAle, a group of like-minded drinkers in Gothenburg, to launch Swedens  rst beer made by women.
We Can Do It was the brainchild of Felicia Nordstro_m, a bar worker who says she was fed up with bearded beer snobs telling her: What do you know about beer, sweetie?
She approached FemAle and they teamed up with Ocean, a local independent micro-brewery.
One weekend they concocted the recipe and the next they brewed 1,600 litres.
FemAle has already been approached by other breweries asking if they can brew new beers with them.
Women opt for a glass of wine because they dont know what beer is all about; they dont know what to order, says Carlsson.
From all across Rwanda, and even parts of neighbouring Burundi, people  ock to the southern town of Butare to a little shop called Inzozi Nziza (Sweet Dreams).
They come for a taste of the unknown, something most have never tasted  the sweet, cold, velvety embrace of ice cream.
The shop, which has ice cream, coffee, dreams across its signage, is milking local curiosity about the dessert  and changing lives in the process, says Inzozi Nzizas manager, Louise Ingabire.
True to Inzozi Nzizas motto, the shop can certainly make dreams come true.
Inzozi Nziza has become a hub for tired students looking to treat themselves to something cool and different.
Most of the ingredients are sourced locally and the milk comes from a depot in nearby Nyanza.
An ice-cream shop, Katese proposed, might help to put the human pieces back together by rebuilding spirits, hopes and family traditions, Miesen says.
At the start, Miesen and Dundas owned the shop in partnership with its staff and had shares in the business, which is a cooperative and non-pro t. They did not set  nancial targets, but waited for 18 months before they transferred their shares to the women, who had by then proved their business credentials.
The Butare shop employs nine women, who spend their spare time practising with Ingoma Nshya, Rwandas  rst and only female drumming troupe, which was established by Katese ten years ago.
The musicians are Hutu and Tutsi women, some survivors of the 1994 genocide, during which almost a million Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed.
When Im drumming with them, it gives me power because were still alive and survivors.
Sweet Dreams, which tells the story of how the women have forged a promising post-genocide future, also includes the female drummers.
We feel the  lm is about resilience, hope, bravery, resourcefulness and the ability to change the course of your own life, says Lisa Fruchtman, who won an Academy Award for  lm- editing in 1984. 
McKinlay believes huge investment will be needed before navigation systems will be good enough to allow technologies such as autonomous vehicles to take off.
According to Ofcom (the Of ce of Communications), around 66% of adults in the UK owned a smartphone in 2015, up from 39% in 2012, making GPS technology widely available.
But McKinlay, a satellite communication and navigation consultant, believes that we should be wary of leaving our navigational needs to our devices.
What we did was to look at a set of current London taxi drivers and a set of London taxi drivers that had been retired for about four years, said neuroscientist Dr Hugo Spiers, head of the Spatial Cognition Group at University College London, who is an author of the study.
The results showed that the retired taxi drivers performed worse on navigation tests than those still behind the wheel.
We were able to show that their abilities did drop away if they werent using their knowledge on that particular test.
There is a genuine potential for risk in relying on a satnav, said Spiers.
But the actual health risk of not using your brain effectively is not known.
Though Spiers believes the development of arti cial intelligence based on machine learning could lead to a new wave of navigational aids, McKinlay remains sceptical.
We will see ever- smarter machines which are very, very task speci c, but the big breakthrough will be when they are able to tune in to what you might be thinking and what you might be wanting to achieve, he said.
She has a series of adventures as Johansson until she is eventually found out and, in the end, dies in a car crash.
Delacourt has tried explaining that he chose to reference Johansson because she is the archetype of beauty today.
Delacourt has become one of Frances best-loved authors; his previous novel, My List of Desires, was translated into 47 languages and is now being adapted into a  lm.
I wrote a real love story and a homage to feminine beauty, especially interior beauty.
I thought she might send me  owers as it was a declaration of love for her, but she didnt understand, Delacourt said.
A study led by one of the UKs leading experts on childrens physical activity has found that school pupils born in those months are  tter than everyone else in their class.
November- and October-born children emerged as  tter, stronger and more powerful than their peers born in the other ten months of the year, especially those whose birthdays fell in April or June.
Dr Gavin Sandercock, from the Centre for Sports and Exercise Science at Essex University, and colleagues found that autumn-born children enjoyed a clear physical advantage over their classmates.
The results revealed that a childs month of birth could make signi cant differences to their levels of cardiovascular  tness, muscle strength and ability to accelerate, all of which predict how good someone is at sport, in which such attributes are vital.
The gap in physical prowess between children in the same class but born in different months was sometimes very wide.
The results show that something other than the relative-age effect  the greater maturity of those born early in the school year  is at work, especially as the  ttest children were not the tallest or heaviest, he added.
The authors believe that autumn-born childrens greater exposure over the summer months, towards the end of pregnancy, to vitamin D  the sunshine vitamin linked to a range of health bene ts  is the most likely explanation.
Seasonal differences in intrauterine vitamin D concentrations seem most plausible, they say.
Children that get a high-quality  rst experience, which develops their physical literacy, are those that will have greater agility, balance and coordination, and are more likely to develop an enjoyment of physical activity and excel in sport as they grow up, he said.
UK Sport could not say if a disproportionately high number of the 1,300 athletes across 47 sports it funds were born in November and October.
She said: Looking at elite, senior athletes, there are many factors that go into making a champion and our work hasnt uncovered anything to suggest that month of birth is one of the key ingredients.     
As soon as the children at one primary school in Stirling hear the words daily mile, they down their pencils and head out of the classroom to start running laps around the school  eld.
For three-and-a-half years, all pupils at St Ninians Primary have walked or run a mile each day.
They do so at random times during the day, apparently happily, and, despite the rise in childhood obesity across the UK, none of the children at the school are overweight.
One in ten children are obese when they start school at the age of four or  ve, according to  gures from the Health & Social Care Information Centre, and, in the summer of 2015, a study found that schoolchildren in England are the least  t they have ever been.
Primary schools have therefore been quick to note the bene ts of the daily mile.
In Stirling alone, 30 schools have already started or are to start the daily mile.
They come back in bright-eyed and rosy-cheeked, how children used to look.
The extent of the bene ts have yet to be determined but researchers from Stirling University have launched a comparative study to look for quantitative evidence of the physical, cognitive and emotional bene ts of the daily mile.
Dr Colin Moran, who is leading the study, said: The children at St Ninians dont seem to have problems with obesity; they seem happier and staff say they settle into lessons faster so we designed a study that would test all of these things.
St Ninians pupils will be compared with children from another school in Stirling that has yet to start the scheme.
Kevin Clelland, a primary school teacher from Leeds, visited St Ninians before convincing his colleagues it was a great idea.
Active Cheshire, a strategic body for sports and  tness in Cheshire and Warrington, is taking a group of senior  gures from the local authority up to Scotland to assess the results of the daily mile.
The hope is to introduce it across the 450 schools in the region if a pilot is successful.
Paralympian, Tanni Grey-Thompson, chair of ukactive, the UKs leading not-for-pro t health body for physical activity, said: All children need to achieve 60 active minutes every day, whether in a lesson, on the walk to school or in the playground.
The Scottish government is also supportive.
Now, for the  rst time, scientists have started to catalogue and map the bacteria coursing through a citys subway  and they have found a wealth of curious results.
Dr Christopher Mason, a geneticist at Weill Cornell Medical College, led a team that, for 18 months, swabbed the New York City subway system for the microscopic life forms that cover its turnstiles, seats, ticket booths and stations.
In what Mason called the  rst city-scale genetic pro le ever, his team found meningitis at Times Square, a trace of anthrax on the handhold of a train carriage and bacteria that cause bubonic plague on a rubbish bin and ticket machine at stations in uptown Manhattan.
Some of the results were expected, Mason said, including some bacteria associated with fecal matter, which he said should be a gentle reminder for people to wash their hands.
All around the subway, bacteria associated with cheeses  brie, cheddar, parmesan and the mozzarella of ubiquitous New York pizza  turned up.
The distinctive bacteria of Swiss cheese were more localized to midtown Manhattan and the  nancial district, and the bacteria used to ferment cabbage for kimchi and sauerkraut showed up in the  nancial district and Bay Ridge.
Species that cause diarrhoea and nausea, both benign and bad E.coli (mostly benign), and the bacteria that can cause skin infections and urinary-tract infections were common all over the city.
If anything, he added, Ive become much more con dent riding the subway.
The next steps, Mason said, are studies of other cities, which have begun in Paris, Sa_o Paolo and Shanghai, and continued studies of New York, for instance to see how the microbiome changes with the seasons.
He said he hoped the research would provide a baseline of research for health of cials and geneticists, and could help health of cials to be better prepared to prevent and track diseases and pathogens. 
David Cameron has declared a clear result in the Scottish independence referendum after Scotland voted by a 10.6-point margin against ending the 307-year-old union with England and Wales.
There can be no disputes, no reruns  we have heard the settled will of the Scottish people, Cameron said in a statement  Earlier, Scotlands  rst minister, Alex Salmond, remained de ant at a downbeat Scottish National Party rally in Edinburgh, saying he accepted Scotland had not, at this stage, decided to vote for independence.
The yes campaign scored four big successes, winning 53% of the vote in Scotlands largest city, Glasgow, 57% in Dundee and 51% in North Lanarkshire.
However, the no camp was victorious in 28 authorities.
It won overwhelmingly in areas where it was expected to do well, including Edinburgh, Aberdeenshire and Borders, but also in areas that could have gone to the yes campaign, including the Western Isles.
In the  nal count, the no camp won 2,001,926 votes (55.3%) to 1,617,989 for yes (44.7%).
And I know that sentiment was shared by people not just across our country but around the world because of what we have achieved together in the past and what we can do together in the future.
Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, said the referendum was a vote from the Scottish people for change.
We know our country needs to change in the way it is governed and we know our country needs to change in who it is governed for.
Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister, said the referendum marks not only a new chapter for Scotland within the UK but also wider constitutional reform across the union.
Echoing the SNPs argument, he said a vote against independence was clearly not a vote against change.
Yet that result raises the risk of further turmoil, with MPs from Camerons Conservative Party threatening to revolt against the prime ministers late and potentially vital promise to quickly increase the Scottish parliaments powers while protecting its spending.
The prime minister wants to move fast to show that the three main UK party leaders will live up to their commitments made during the referendum campaign to deliver what the former prime minister Gordon Brown called home rule within the UK.
SeaWorld has suffered an 84% collapse in pro ts as customers have deserted the controversial aquatic theme park company following claims it mistreated orca whales.
Following the release of the documentary, attendance collapsed, the company lost more than half of its market value on Wall Street and its former CEO was forced out.
On the reputation side, early feedback on our campaign has been positive.
We will continue to  ght with the facts because the facts are on our side, he said recently on a conference call with journalists and analysts.
Manby, who joined the company as CEO in 2015 to help the company rehabilitate itself, said he would set out his vision for the future of the company at a special event on 6 November.
Already in the pipeline are plans for a new shark exhibition in Orlando and an attraction in San Antonio that will allow customers to swim with dolphins in a naturalistic setting.
Jared Goodman, director of animal law for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), which has been leading campaigns against SeaWorld, said: SeaWorld is in the midst of a spying scandal, animals are dying in its tanks and tens of thousands of people have opposed its bid to build a new orca prison so it should come as no surprise that SeaWorlds quarterly earnings have plummeted yet again in the second quarter.
SeaWorlds shares, which were worth $39 in 2013, were changing hands for just under $18 in August 2015. 
Stratford remained hugely important throughout Shakespeares life, argues Paul Edmondson, the head of learning and research at the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust.
People have seen Shakespeare as someone who turns his back on Stratford and his family, goes to London to earn his fortune and only comes back to die, he said.
The anniversary of the death of the man from Stratford, the most famous and the most performed playwright in the world, will be marked across Britain and the globe.
In London, they are also creating a 37-screen pop-up cinema, one screen to showcase each of Shakespeares plays, along the South Bank.
The National Theatre, the Royal Shakespeare Company and virtually every other theatre production company in the country will be marking the anniversary.
The plays would scarcely have survived if his friends and fellow actors had not gathered together every scrap of every play they could  nd  drafts, prompt scripts, scribbled actors parts and 17 plays not known in any other version  into the precious First Folio published in 1623, seven years after Shakespeares death.
The Shakespeare Birthplace Trust describes New Place as the jewel in the crown of the 400th anniversary celebrations but, in truth, it is more of a gaping hole where the gem should be.
The low rumble of passing ships has long been connected to the disturbance of large whales.
But, US researchers have documented persistent noise also occurring at medium and higher frequencies, including at 20,000Hz where killer whales, also known as orcas, hear best.
The  ndings suggest that the noise could well affect the endangered population of killer whales that are found near the shipping lanes.
The main concern relating to this is that even a slight increase in sound may make echolocation more dif cult for whales, said Scott Veirs of Beamreach, who led the research.
The researchers used underwater microphones to measure the noise created by about 1,600 individual ships as they passed through Haro Strait, in Washington State.
The two-year study captured the sounds made by 12 different types of vessel, including cruise ships, container ships and military vehicles, that passed through the strait about 20 times a day.
Whales are not usually located right next to ships and so would be subjected to noise of about 60 to 90 decibels  around the level of a lawnmower or a vacuum cleaner.
But, the new research underlines the threat posed to smaller whales, dolphins and porpoises.
Ships have been thought of as low- frequency sources of noise, like the rumbling of lorries or trains, he said.
And, should they fail to  nd prey as effectively, they will need to use up their stores of excess blubber.
This is problematic as this blubber often contains manmade pollutants that are toxic to whales if released fully into their systems.
Veirs said more work needs to be done to identify how badly the noise is affecting whales and also to quieten the ships that pass near the cetaceans.
Military ships are quite a bit quieter and there could be straightforward ways of transferring that technology to the commercial  eet.
Decreasing speed by six knots could decrease noise intensity by half.
While the fortunes of some whale species, such as humpbacks and blue whales, the largest mammal on Earth, have improved as whaling has declined, others are still under threat from a range of factors.
The US federal government has recently protected nearly 40,000 square miles of the Atlantic in an attempt to avoid losing the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale, a species with just 500 individuals left.
In Europe, killer whales are carrying dangerously high levels of banned polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) chemicals in their blubber.
Meanwhile, around the coast of Australia, whales face an increased threat from ship strikes and oil and gas drilling, as well as Japans recent pledge to resume whaling in Antarctic waters. 
It was not so much how hard people found the challenge but how far they would go to avoid it that left researchers gobsmacked.
So unbearable did some  nd it that they took up the safe but alarming opportunity to give themselves mild electric shocks in an attempt to break the tedium.
The difference, scientists suspect, is that men tend to be more sensation-seeking than women.
The report from psychologists at Virginia and Harvard Universities is one of a surprising few to tackle the question of why most of us  nd it so hard to do nothing.
In more than 11 separate studies, the researchers showed that people hated being left to think, regardless of their age, education, income or the amount of time they spent using smartphones or social media.
Timothy Wilson, who led the work, said the  ndings were not necessarily a re ection of the pace of modern life or the spread of mobile devices and social media.
Instead, those things might be popular because of our constant urge to do something rather than nothing.
The  rst run of experiments began with students being ushered  alone, without phones, books or anything to write with  into an unadorned room and told to think.
To see if the effect was found only in students, the scientists recruited more than 100 people, aged 18 to 77, from a church and a farmers market.
To check whether people might actually prefer something bad to nothing at all, the students were given the option of administering a mild electric shock.
They had been asked earlier to rate how unpleasant the shocks were, alongside other options, such as looking at pictures of cockroaches or hearing the sound of a knife rubbing against a bottle.
Jessica Andrews-Hanna at the University of Colorado said many students would probably zap themselves to cheer up a tedious lecture.
But, she says more needs to be known about the motivation of the shockers in Wilsons study.
Imagine the setup  a person is told to sit in a chair with wires attached to their skin and a button that will deliver a harmless but uncomfortable shock, and they are told to just sit there and entertain themselves with their thoughts, she said.
As they sit there, strapped to this machine, their mind starts to wander and it naturally goes to that shock  was it really that bad?
Pick up a boot and a camera will make sure you dont slip it into your bag.
Joe Jensen, of Intels Retail Solutions Division, says that the aim of bringing RealSense technology into shops is not to create databases of speci c peoples lives but rather to build generalized models of peoples lifestyles and shopping habits.
Its not so much that you need to know a particular customer.
Its that you need to know that this shopper has these characteristics and, in the past, that when those characteristics are present, this is what a person tends to do.
That could allow a retailer to automatically put targeted ads on screens aimed speci cally at that person.
If you search for something on Amazon, youll be hounded by targeted banners for similar products on other sites.
It turns out that people do not react to cameras in the same way as they do to browser cookies.
Hoxton Analytics, a London-based team of data scientists, has developed a technology that makes use of machine learning and arti cial intelligence to categorize people based on the shoes they are wearing.
By analysing the style and size of peoples footwear as they walk past the sensor, the system can identify a customers gender with between 75 and 80% accuracy.
Owen McCormack, Hoxton Analytics CEO, says that the focus of the system came about in part as a reaction to facial recognition.
My idea was, why dont we simply consider the clothes someones wearing to understand demographics?
If I just showed you a shot of someones body you could probably tell me what gender they are.
However, it turns out pointing a camera at someones chest or hips feels just as creepy as facial recognition.
The word creepy comes up a lot during discussions of in-store tracking.
From the perspective of retailers, its understandable that physical shops want some of the information online outlets collect.
Whatever the case, there are a growing number of eyes between the shelves and they care a lot about what youre wearing. 
They may not know who Steve Jobs was or even how to tie their own shoelaces, but the average six-year-old child understands more about digital technology than a 45-year-old adult, according to an authoritative new report.
The advent of broadband in the year 2000 has created a generation of digital natives, Ofcom (which checks standards in the UK communications industries) says in its annual study of British consumers.
As a result of growing up in the digital age, they are developing fundamentally different communication habits from older generations, even compared to what we call the early adopters, the 16-to-24 age group.
Ofcom devised a digital quotient, or DQ, test to put 800 children and 2,000 adults through their paces, which, rather than measuring intelligence, as an IQ test would, attempts to gauge awareness of and self-con dence around gadgets from tablets to smart watches, knowledge of superfast internet, 4G mobile- phone networks and mobile apps.
Digital understanding peaks between 14 and 15 years of age, when the average is a DQ of 113, and then drops gradually throughout adulthood, before falling rapidly in old age.
The ways in which millennial children contact each other and consume entertainment are so different from previous generations that forecasters now consider their preferences a better indication of the future than those of trendsetting young adults.
Two decades ago, teenagers devoted their evenings to monopolizing the home telephone line, dissecting love affairs and friendships in conversations that lasted for hours.
Just 2% of childrens time is spent emailing, compared to 33% for adults.
They spend 20% of their time viewing short video clips, for example on YouTube, or news clips distributed via Facebook and other social sites.
Young adults aged 16 to 24 are voracious consumers of almost all media.
They call him the Robin Hood of the banks, a man who took out dozens of loans, worth almost half a million euros, with no intention of ever paying them back.
Instead, Enric Duran handed the money out to projects that created and promoted alternatives to capitalism.
After 14 months in hiding, Duran is unapologetic, even though his activities could land him in jail.
Im proud of what I did, he said in an interview by Skype from an undisclosed location.
Meanwhile, our reliance on perpetual growth was creating a system that created money out of nothing.
He spent two months in prison before being bailed for 50,000.
His actions, he said, were in the vanguard of a worldwide debate on the economic crisis.
In his case, he said, the element of reciprocity he could offer to banks might lie in the insight he gleaned from years of obtaining bank loans fraudulently.
More than 25,000 kilos of dead  sh were collected in the aftermath and nearly 2,000 adult birds, chicks, eggs and nests were killed or destroyed.
Suddenly aware of Donanas status as the nations most important natural site, Spain decided to spend a further 360m, some of it EU money, on restoring the landscape, which, in the 1950s and 60s, had been drained in places to create rice and cotton  elds.
However, the real body blow for conservationists has been the recent decision of the Andalucian government to reopen the Frailes mine that so very nearly destroyed Donana in 1998.
Donana already faces a great number of threats, but now they want to bring back the very cause of its near-undoing 16 years ago.
The crash of Spains banks in 2008 hit the region catastrophically and unemployment in some parts of Andalucia is now more than 30%.
Reopening the mine would provide more than 1,000 precious jobs.
"There are riches here, riches that are badly needed by local inhabitants, said Vicente Fernandez Guerrero, secretary-general of Innovation, Industry and Energy for Andalucia.
People have been digging metals and ores here since Roman times, after all.
More to the point, added Fernandez, the mine licence would stipulate that only modern mining techniques, which avoid the creation of poisonous wet waste, would be allowed.
The proposal has some support in the area, but it also has a lot of opposition.
For his part, Carlos Davila, who works for the Spanish Ornithological Society in Donana, was also alarmed at the proposal.
This is a very, very bad idea indeed, he told me.
Nor should this be surprising, for this is a truly special place.
The trouble is that Spain does not have the public resources it possessed 16 years ago.
This point is backed by Davila.
After the disaster, Spain woke up to the fact that it possessed a place of real ecological importance and did a lot to clean it up and protect it, he added.
That movie will outline a rebel mission to steal the plans of the Death Star, a key plot element of the  rst  lm in 1977.
In creating a multi-stranded, multi-character cinema universe around Star Wars, Lucas lm-Disney are taking their cue from the phenomenally successful series of  lms produced by Marvel Studios, which Disney also acquired, in 2009.
Disney has brought a whole new level of marketing savvy to an already popular product: Dergarabedian cites the decision to make all six existing Star Wars  lms available on streaming services as a brilliant way to build the anticipation for the new  lm and reinvigorate the idea of Star Wars in the minds of the fans.
Michael Rosser, news editor for Screen International, suggests that it is this shared universe of highly infectious nostalgia that keeps Star Wars in pole position among  lm franchises.
Rosser is referring to the three  lms Lucas directed between 1999 and 2005  The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith  which chronicled the life of Luke Skywalkers father, Anakin, who transforms into Darth Vader.
It shows the power of Star Wars that, although they were disappointing, the prequels still managed to make a lot of money, said Rosser.
They are also trying to bring people into the cinema at a time when lots are staying home for entertainment.
Meanwhile, Dergarabedian is anticipating massive business when The Force Awakens reaches cinemas in December 2015.
We are certainly looking at a record opening for December and it should go on to make at least a billion dollars worldwide.
We may not yet be living in an age of  ying cars, as predicted in the 1985  lm Back to the Future II, but the rise of smartphones and other new technologies is creating a reality that is arguably as exciting and almost as far-fetched.
Experts agree that economic and demographic changes, technological advances, and environmental concerns are fundamentally altering the transportation landscape.
Theres a focus on a tighter connection between the role of transportation and the economic health of cities and its impact on people.
Connectivity The rise of ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft  essentially taxis booked at the click of a smartphone button  and apps like Waze, which uses real-time traf c data to  nd the quickest routes for drivers, are dramatically changing how people get around and affecting the very way in which traf c moves through a city.
Meanwhile, those still driving cars are dealing with less traf c thanks to Waze.
Companies are working to develop technology that will enable a vehicle to tell traf c control systems not only that it is present but also where it is going and how fast it is travelling.
But, even if driverless technology were ready to hit the roads now, it would take a long time to get fully automated given the average age of cars on the road is 11.5 years old.
DNA taken from the wisdom tooth of a European hunter-gatherer has given scientists an unprecedented glimpse of modern humans before the rise of farming.
He was probably lactose intolerant and had more difficulty digesting starchy foods than the farmers who transformed diets and lifestyles when they took up tools in the first agricultural revolution.
But scientists may have overestimated the impact farming had in shaping the human immune system, because tests on the hunter-gatherers DNA found that he already carried mutations that boost the immune system to tackle various nasty bugs.
The Spanish team started their work after a group of cavers stumbled upon two skeletons in a deep and complex cave system high up in the Cantabrian Mountains of northwest Spain in 2006.
Carbon dating put the remains at around 7,000 years old, before farming had swept into Europe from the Middle East.
It is the first time researchers have obtained the complete genome of a modern European who lived before the Neolithic revolution.
The results suggest that blue eye colour came first in Europe, with the transition to lighter skin ongoing through Mesolithic times.
You never see a reconstruction of a Mesolithic hunter-gatherer with dark skin and blue eye colour, Lalueza-Fox said.
The Spanish team went on to compare the genome of the hunter-gatherer to those of modern Europeans from different regions to see how they might be related.
Martin Jones, professor of archaeological science at Cambridge University, said the immunity genes were the most striking result.
Two mothers in South Africa have discovered they are raising each others daughters after they were mistakenly switched at birth in a hospital in 2010.
But, while one of the women wants to correct the error and reclaim her biological child, the other is refusing to give back the girl she has raised as her own, posing a huge legal dilemma.
Henk Strydom, a lawyer for one of the mothers, who cannot be identified because of a court order, described the inadvertent swap as a travesty and tragedy that is unlikely to have a happy ending.
Strydom continued: The man denied he was the father.
Strydom said of his client: She said there are resemblances to herself.
The woman reportedly became unhappy with the process and approached the childrens court in a bid to gain custody of her biological child, but the other mother refused.
Its four years later: you can understand she doesnt want to give up her baby.
The High Court in Pretoria has appointed the University of Pretorias Centre for Child Law to investigate what will now be in the best interests of the children, which is the guiding principle under South African law.
He said at this point, he and his client do not want to sue the hospital or government health department, which is currently helping with the case and providing counselling.
The children and mothers will undergo full and thorough clinical assessments and may be seen by a psychologist.
It is not the first child-swap case to come to light in South Africa.
He grew up on welfare and became a truck driver, whereas his biological siblings  and the boy brought up in his place  attended private secondary schools and universities.
From glow-in-the-dark trees to underground bike sheds and solar-powered bins, we look at some of the more left eld solutions to help make our cities more livable.
City living has many upsides but a sustainable lifestyle is increasingly not among them.
Pollution, traf c and loss of green spaces are just some of the daily trials that city-dwellers have to deal with.

Agios Efstratios is so remote, so forgotten by the banks, the government and most of the modern world that the mobile phone network cant process data and there isnt a single ATM or credit-card machine on the island.
Residents have been forced to make nine-hour round trips to the nearest big island to get cash and Greek visitors say they cant get together enough money to come.
Tourist numbers are down 80% this year, said Mayor Maria Kakali, in an of ce in the village where she grew up, home to around 200 people.
Kakali has badgered the government and a major Greek bank into promising an ATM within weeks but she still feels it may come too late for this season on an island where tourism dwarfs the two other sources of income:  shing and agriculture: We have almost no reservations in August, when usually we have people calling us up asking to  nd a room and we cant help them.
Everything, even milk or bread, has changed hands three or four times before it gets to us and each middleman has to take a pro t, said Provatas Costas, a 58-year-old  sherman.

If taxes go up, even more young people will leave, warns Mayor Kakali, who has devoted her year in of ce to improving education on the island to help keep it an attractive place for families.

As colourful  sh were swimming past him off the Greek coast, Cathal Redmond was convinced he had taken some great photos with his  rst underwater camera.
Having taken the pictures while holding his breath underwater, he blamed the limited time he had to set up the shots.
He vowed to make the little extra time needed a reality and the result is his invention of the Express Dive  a re llable air storage device, held in the mouth, that lets users swim underwater for two minutes.
So, rather than just get in underwater and spend 30 seconds holding their breath, I wanted to do a little bit more than they were able to do, says Redmond, 27.
The real problem is that it is very limiting as to what you can do.
It was during a  nal-year project for his product design degree at the University of Limerick that Redmond produced the Express Dive.
When above the surface, the unit uses a fan to suck in air via a vent in the mouthpiece.
When air is no longer being taken in, the vent shuts off and, as the user dives, air is fed back via the mouthpiece.
The device can take in enough air for two minutes of diving and takes approximately the same amount of time to be re lled.
He likens it to an extension of the lungs in that the user is taking a deep breath and then using it underwater.
It is an extension of the bodys capacity to store air, he says.
Redmond says he has shown that the motor can compress two minutes worth of air into the unit and that the design can be effectively held in the divers mouth.
But, with enough testing, Redmond is con dent he can get a fully functioning device that will not endanger swimmers underwater.
To anyone who thinks two minutes of air is no more than a minor improvement on snorkelling, Redmond says it could make all the difference underwater.
She last deactivated her account in December 2015 after  nding the amount of personal information shared by others too heavy to deal with on top of her work demands.
A lot of my job is listening to peoples lives all day, every day and it started to feel so overwhelming to go on social media and see every single detail of everybodys life, including people that I dont really have a relationship with, she said.
She added: Im holding a lot in my work life for people and sometimes it felt like it was too heavy to do in my personal life also.

His billing, The Beale Street Blues Boy, was shortened to Blues Boy King and thence to BB.
He was always ready to praise the musicians who had in uenced him and would usually mention T-Bone Walker first.
He once explained that his guitar technique was partly based on his lack of skill: I started to bend notes because I could never play in the bottleneck style, like Elmore James and Booker White.
The 1965 album Live at the Regal, however, proved the durability of Kings blues repertoire and has become iconic, a turning point in the early listening of many younger musicians.
He had further R&B hits with blues numbers including How Blue Can You Get and Paying the Cost to Be the Boss, and, in 1969, he hit the upper reaches of the pop charts  where no blues artist had been for many years  with The Thrill Is Gone.
About a year and a half ago, he said in 1969, all of a sudden, kids started coming up to me saying, Youre the greatest blues guitarist in the world.
Guided by his manager, Sidney Seidenberg, he embarked on international concert tours that took him to Japan, Australia, China and Russia.

In 1990, King was diagnosed with diabetes and cut back his touring but not so much that his followers outside the US could not catch up with him every year or two.
The celebrations for his 80th birthday, in 2005, included an award-winning album of collaborations with Clapton, Mark Knop er, Roger Daltrey, Gloria Estefan and others, tributes from musicians as diverse as Bono, Amadou Bagayoko and Elton John, and a farewell tour that proved not to be a farewell at all.
Statistics suggest that vaping among smokers and recent ex-smokers, who comprise the vast majority of vapers, may already be on the decline.
Figures released in 2014 by the health charity Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) reveal that usage among adults in Britain of electronic cigarettes  which do not contain tobacco and produce vapour, not smoke  tripled from an estimated 700,000 users in 2012 to 2.1 million in 2014.
However,  gures collated by the Smoking Toolkit Study, a research body backed by the Department of Health that provides quarterly updates on smoking trends, show vapings appeal may be waning.
The drop is described as statistically signi cant by Professor Robert West, of UCLs Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, who collates the  gures for the Toolkit.
Smokers are the key group for e-cigarette  rms because seven out of ten vapers are smokers.
Weve only been tracking vaping for just over a year, so its a short time period, but we are not seeing growth in the number of long-term ex-smokers or never smokers using e-cigarettes.
That is not to say vaping rates might not change but, at this stage, it looks like theyre staying the same.
The levelling off in popularity of vaping in the UK would appear to be at odds with what is happening in the US, where the technology has been promoted aggressively and where recent reports suggested it was growing in popularity.
Instead, e-cigarettes seem to be most popular among adults seeking to quit.
While the  gures published this month by Smoking In England show that the use of electronic cigarettes by smokers has levelled off, their data also shows the huge increase in use since May 2011, said James Dunworth, director and co-founder of ecigarettedirect.co.uk.
E-cigarettes are behaving like a souped-up nicotine patch, West agreed.
It emerged recently that the European Commission (EC) is looking at increasing taxes on e-cigarettes, something that could have an impact on their popularity.
This may mean vapers will have to increase their usage to obtain the same hit, again something that may make e-cigarettes more expensive.
West suggested that policymakers should see e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation aid and not subject them to the same regulations as smoking.
It just sounds like youre having a go at vapers and hitting everyone with a sledgehammer and that undermines the public health messages were trying to get out.
Vienna is the worlds best city to live in, Baghdad is the worst and London, Paris and New York do not even make it into the top 35, according to international research into quality of life.
Viennese-born Helena Hartlauer, 32, said she was not surprised at her citys top position.
The municipalitys social democratic government has a long tradition of investing in high-quality social housing, making Vienna almost uniquely affordable among major cities.
I live in a 100sq-metre turn-of-the-century apartment in a good area about 20 minutes walk from the city centre.
An equivalent apartment in London would cost upwards of 2,000 and even more in New York, ranked 44th in the table.
You dont realize how safe Vienna is until you head abroad, said Hartlauer.
Vienna bene ted enormously from the fall of the Berlin Wall, becoming the gateway to Eastern European countries that often have historic ties to the former Austro-Hungarian empire.
Our big USP is our geographical location, said Martin Eichtinger, Austrian ambassdaor to London, who lived in Vienna for 20 years.
The fall of the Berlin Wall helped de ne Vienna as the hub for companies wanting to do business in Central Europe.
According to the World Bank, Austria has one of the highest  gures for GDP per head in the world, just behind the US and ahead of Germany and Britain, although quite some way below neighbouring Switzerland.
Zurich in Switzerland is named by Mercer as having the worlds second highest quality of life but the Viennese say their city is far more fun.
Its a very fast growing, young and lively city, she added  though she conceded she works for the citys tourist board.
But, after an increase in budget  ights from regional British cities such as Manchester and Edinburgh, Vienna is fast catching up as a popular destination.
Vienna has ranked top in the last seven published rankings, said Mercer.
It scores highly in a number of categories; it provides a safe and stable environment to live in, a high level of public utilities and transport facilities and good recreational facilities.
Paris remained stable for several years but has, this year, dropped ten places in the overall ranking, said Mercer.
Australian cities also perform very highly in the survey, with Sydney 10th and Melbourne 15th.
All restaurants should have to publicly state their exact tipping procedure.
Elle, 22, Edinburgh: We never know whether its fair Average tips: 20 per eight-hour shift I think they treat waiters best in ... France  I work three jobs, all on part-time zero-hours contracts, in catering and hospitality.
In restaurants, because a lot of customers add tips through card payments, the staff never actually see how much is getting tipped  so we dont know whether were getting our fair share or not.
The system seems better in France, where they dont tip much but waiting tables is seen as a proper job, offering job security and a decent income.
Equally, when a member of the team does incredibly well, they dont get what theyve earned.
The managers should have ways to pay for broken glasses and plates without docking our tips.
I make around 20 a shift but would only be given 10-15 of that money.
Id rather we earned a good basic wage (like in Australia) and therefore didnt have to rely on tips to make ends meet.
Tom, Manchester: A big night of tips can help pay the rent Average tips: 40 per eight-hour shift I think they treat waiters best in ... Italy  Where I used to work,  oor staff kept 80% of cash tips and 40% of card tips.
The other 20% of cash went into a pot for the commis waiters and service bar.
Its hard to say how much I earned a shift; maybe around 40, 20 from card tips.
They have got tipping right in Italy, where people dont add a service charge but usually round up their bill so, if they get a meal for 19, they leave a 20 note and dont ask for change.

Professor Robin Dunbar is famous for his research that suggests a person can only have roughly 150 people as a social group.
An overwhelming majority of 91% post a photo of themselves, 71% post the city or town where they live, up from 61%, more than half give email addresses and a  fth give their phone number.
More than 80% list their interests, allowing brands to target them most effectively.
But most younger users do restrict their pro les, with 60% allowing friends only.

4 Facebook has been the tool to organize revolutions Though the Arab Spring was dubbed the Twitter revolution, organizing demonstrations and direct action has been revolutionized by Facebook.
Manchester Universitys Olga Onuch found Facebook had been the key medium for reaching half of all the Euromaidan protesters in Ukraine.

Each year, 1.3bn tonnes of food, about a third of all that is produced, is wasted, including about 45% of all fruit and vegetables, 35% of  sh and seafood, 30% of cereals, 20% of dairy products and 20% of meat.
Estimates suggest that, by 2050, food production will need to have increased by 60% on 2005 levels to feed a growing global population.
The problem is global but manifests itself in very different ways.
In wealthy countries, there are low levels of unintentional losses but high levels of food waste, which involves food being thrown away by consumers because they have purchased too much or by retailers who reject food because of strict aesthetic standards.
The carbon footprint of food produced and not eaten is estimated at 3.3 gigatonnes of CO2, meaning that, if food waste were a country, it would rank as the third highest national emitter of greenhouse gases after the US and China.
About 1.4bn hectares, or close to 30% of available agricultural land, is used to grow or farm food that is subsequently wasted.
And more surface and groundwater, or blue water, is used to produce wasted food around the globe than is used for agriculture by any single country, including India and China.
The whole issue of climate change has to do with our economy of production and consumption being out of balance with what the Earth can provide, says van Otterdijk.
Production of food is one of the biggest production sectors in the world and, if one-third of all this is just produced in vain, you can imagine what a huge impact this has on the natural resources  on land, water, energy and greenhouse gas emissions.
The worst food waste offenders are the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, where consumers waste 39% of all food purchased, followed by Europe, where about 31% of all food purchased by consumers is thrown away.
This means that 11.7% of all food purchased is avoidably wasted, at an estimated cost to each family of 700 a year or almost 60 a month.
According to a nationwide analysis of food waste in UK households, the most wasted food in the UK by weight is bread, with consumers throwing away 414,000 tonnes (22.4%) of all bread purchased.
The UK has made progress in the past ten years, after a concerted campaign to reduce wastage.
Between 2007 and 2012, the amount of avoidable food waste produced by UK households decreased by 21%, from 5.3m tonnes to 4.2m tonnes, largely due to greater awareness.
Van Otterdijk says there has been a very encouraging, unexpected, continuing interest in the subject of food waste, enabling grass-roots campaigns around the world to gain momentum.
But if it continues like this, with the same momentum, maybe, after ten years, well have globally signi cant results. 
Clay Cockrell is sitting in his of ce at Columbus Circle, across the street from 1 Central Park West, which houses Trump International Hotel and Tower.
Cockrell, a former Wall Street worker turned therapist, spends large parts of his days walking through Central Park or the Battery Park in downtown Manhattan near Wall Street, as a con dant and counsellor to some of New Yorks wealthiest people.
So, what issues are Americas 1% struggling with?
And, then, there is the isolation  being in the 1%, it turns out, can be lonely.
The Occupy Wall Street movement was a good one and had some important things to say about income inequality but it singled out the 1% and painted them globally as something negative, said Jamie Traeger-Muney, a wealth psychologist and founder of the Wealth Legacy Group.
Traeger-Muney runs a global  rm and specializes in working with inheritors, who often get a bad reputation in the press.
You would never refer to another group of people in the way that it seems perfectly normal to refer to wealth holders.

According to research from Spectrem Group, in 2014, the number of US households with $1m or more in assets  excluding the value of their primary home  increased by 500,000 to 10.1m.
Since the 2008  nancial crisis, the income gap has expanded and the situation has gotten worse for the wealthy, Cockrell said.
Never being able to trust your friendships with people of different means, I think that is dif cult, said Cockrell.
These are real fears faced by the richest of the rich.
In 2007, the Gates Foundation teamed up with Boston Colleges Center on Wealth and Philanthropy to document what it felt like to be in Americas 1%.
For the next four years, researchers surveyed 165 of Americas richest households  120 of those households have at least $25m in assets.
The resulting study, The Joys and Dilemmas of Wealth, was 500 pages long and seemed to prove the old adage that money cant buy happiness.
Some Americans have taken to keeping their wealth secret.
There are a lot of people that are hiding their wealth because they are concerned about negative judgment, said Traeger-Muney.
Speaking in his soft, soothing voice that makes you want to spill all your worries, Cockrell said that a common mistake that many of his wealthy clients make is letting their money de ne them.
According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), there were just 41m subscribers using music streaming services globally in 2014.
Leaked information recently suggested that Apple is aiming to reach 100m subscribers, which, based on a subscription fee of $120 per year, would generate $12bn annually.
Apple is good at mainstreaming products but its not that good.
Apple managed to persuade consumers to pay for downloads and grew a huge business, which it dominated, with an estimated 70% market share.
Apple holds the lions share of this, making it the single biggest music retailer in the world.
But download revenue peaked in 2013 in the UK at 283m and fell to 249m in 2014.
The decline in download sales hit the US in 2013 so Apple bought Beats in 2014 for $3bn, not only to get into the premium headphone market, but also to make the transition from music ownership (downloads) to music access (subscription streaming).
Apple, and the record industry, cannot afford to get rid of the download market just yet  so streaming and downloading will have to coexist under the Apple brand, one representing the future as the other gets progressively slower and sicker.
The average spend of a music buyer in the UK in 2014, for example, was just 39.52, according to research.
Apple have previously tried to build an artist-friendly platform via iTunes.
They called it Ping and it didnt work.
There is the smell of revolution in the air and Apple is making sure its on the right side of the battle lines when they are drawn up.
This is going to be the interesting bit when the service actually goes live.
Getting exclusives for big albums is going to become crucial to streaming.
Apple will have been watching this carefully and making its own notes.
Nowadays, its lowest point, Piazza San Marco (only three feet above sea level) is inundated with water approximately 100 times annually.
In many parts of the world, the land is also sinking  in Venices case, subsoil compaction (a result of industrial exploitation of the surrounding area) lowered the city by 20cm between 1950 and 1970.
Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam is also sinking by about 2cm a year  but thats nothing compared to Jakarta, which is dropping 10 to 20cm annually.
Unfortunately for the Indonesian capital, it has pumped out so much groundwater to support its population that the land above is drying out and compacting, thereby creating a bowl.
While there are many plans to save Venice  and Ho Chi Minh City and Jakarta are taking the problem seriously  the same cannot be said for Miami, where politicians refuse to admit the city has a severe environmental problem.
The Florida resort lies less than ten feet above sea level; an increasing number of tropical storms are inundating the city; and it is built on porous limestone, which is absorbing the rising seawater.
This water then  lls the citys foundations and bubbles up through drains and pipes, forcing sewage upwards and polluting its fresh water.
In the Maldives, the populations of whole islands are now looking to abandon their homes.
The capital, Male_, population 153,379 and only four feet above sea level, has used Japanese investment to build a ten-foot sea wall at a cost of $63 million  but, long term, only a stabilization of rising sea levels will save it and the rest of the islands.
This city is just one example of a problem caused not so much by global warming as human over-expansion in the face of  nite resources.
Californias dream of farming the desert made sense while its total population remained around half a million (in 1870)  but, now, the state is home to 38 million people, who, between them, own 32 million vehicles and expect to be surrounded by lawns and golf courses.
The daily water use in Rancho Mirage is more than 200 gallons per person, which is giving rise to a man-made drought.
A 25% cut in water consumption has been implemented but this is unlikely to stabilize the resort, which is surrounded by sand and dust.
The long-term answer in Californias desert is likely to be the abandonment of some cities while consolidating the populations of others.
Fire is a growing threat to urban settlements in America  in fact, forest  res cause the most damage after severe storms, with 800 major  re disasters having been declared there between 1953 and 2014.
Many cities are  ghting a losing battle against the ravages of nature but is it possible to identify the worlds most vulnerable metropolis?
And, if they disappear, so does Males raison detre. 
Im ready to give up at 45 seconds but I push on through and it seems to get easier for a while.
By the end of the session, I think Id managed a prodigious 90 seconds of breath-holding, enough to let me swim a width.
I asked how she did it: very slow breathing for several minutes prior to each dive, then a big, deep breath before diving in.
Its even been said that humans have an ability to lower heart rate and metabolic rate in order to breath-hold for even longer.
And experimental evidence shows that heart rate doesnt drop during breath-holding.
This reduction in heart rate is just one of the physiological responses that are sometimes described together as the mammalian diving re ex.
While our ability to breath-hold may not be all that special, when we compare ourselves with other animals, its now proving very useful in one particular area of medicine.
Radiotherapy for breast cancer involves directing radiation, very precisely, at the tumour.
This may require several minutes worth of radiation and, so, its usually done in short bursts, between breaths.
But, if the patient can keep her chest perfectly still for several minutes, it means that the entire dose can be delivered, in the right place, in one go.
The problem, of course, is that most people, just like me, struggle to hold their breath for much longer than a minute.
When you breathe in, youre contracting the muscle of your diaphragm, pulling it  at so that the volume of your chest increases  and air is drawn into your lungs.
Arti cially raising oxygen levels and reducing carbon dioxide levels before a breath-hold, as in the Birmingham radiotherapy experiments, may work by delaying fatigue in the diaphragm.
First, there was the time he outraged prisoners of war by doubting the heroism of Vietnam veteran John McCain because he allowed himself to be captured.
As if PoWs, Fox News and women were not enemies enough, Trump has also insulted Mexican immigrants to the US, claimed that a Black Lives Matter protester who was violently ejected from a rally deserved to be roughed up, appeared to mock a New York Times journalist for his disability and falsely accused Muslim Americans of cheering on the 9/11 attackers.
But, he has nonetheless refused to retract any of the comments.
Some rivals still hope that, eventually, even Trumps supporters will tire of what critics view as his relentless attacks on minorities in particular.
As he delights in telling supporters, the three issues that he rails against most  immigration reform, free-trade deals and Barack Obamas national security policy  have become perhaps the de ning issues of the election.
might sound unrealistic but they have arguably destroyed the campaign hopes of Jeb Bush, who favours immigration reform.
Among Americans who identify as Republicans, current polls suggest he has 25-30% of the vote.
In the battle for hearts and minds, converting Trumps passionate supporters will be hard.
This scenario can be best understood by looking at responses to the question: Are there any of these candidates you would de nitely not support for the Republican nomination for president?
Steve Deace, a prominent Iowa conservative, said that Trumps antics are both a good and a bad thing.
On the other hand, it limits your ability to grow beyond that.
As the pollster notes: Trump says what theyre thinking and, the more outrageous he is, the more they agree with him.
That is certainly the feeling among ordinary  supporters who have attended his increasingly packed campaign events in recent months.
Sometimes life just isnt fair.
There have been arguments for years over who should of cially go down in history as the inventor of the ATM and, in 2005, a man called John Shepherd-Barron received a UK honour for services to banking as the inventor of the automatic cash dispenser.
But, the UK government is now saying it was Goodfellow who invented the ATM  so it would seem that, after all the squabbling, his place in history is now assured.
Back in the mid-1960s, Goodfellow was working as a development engineer and had been asked to devise a way to enable customers to withdraw cash from banks on Saturdays.
I set out to develop a cash-issuing machine and, to make this a reality, I invented the PIN [personal identi cation number] and an associated coded token.
His machine didnt use plastic cards  instead, it used cheques impregnated with carbon-14, a mildly radioactive substance.
It is widely accepted that the Shepherd-Barron ATM was the worlds  rst when it comes to being installed and used by the public; the  rst one, at a bank in north London, was opened on 27 June, 1967  a month before Goodfellows ATM made its public debut.
However, the patent for Goodfellows machine was lodged on 2 May, 1966, 14 months before the London ATM machine came into service.
That really stuck in my throat and I kicked up a bit of a fuss.
Shepherd-Barron is no longer alive to put his case but, in a 2005 interview, he was fairly withering about his rival: I dont know him but its clear that the difference between Goodfellow and us was that we thought through the whole system concept and that was important to the banks who bought it.
The website ATMInventor.com concludes: Who invented the idea of an ATM?
We have to think it was James Goodfellow in Scotland for holding a patent date of 1966. Who invented the ATM design we recognize today?
We think it was John D White for Docutel in the US.
So after all these years, Goodfellow  nally  nds himself being talked about in the same breath as John Logie Baird (the television), Alan Turing (the Turing machine), Sir Frank Whittle (the jet engine) and Sir Tim Berners-Lee (the World Wide Web).
Asked what he did with the 10 he received back in the 1960s, Goodfellow says he thinks he blew it on a wild night out, adding: It didnt change my life.
Our new international survey across 33 countries shows just how wrong the world is about a range of key social realities.
In Britain, people think that an extraordinary 43% of young adults aged 25-34 still live at home with their parents, rather than the actual 14%.
People also take mental shortcuts, where they grab for easily available information even if it doesnt quite  t the question.
Our study was mostly carried out through an online survey  and, in developing countries, this will be representative of a more af uent, connected group rather than the population as a whole.
But what we  nd, throughout the study, is that people grossly generalize from their own situations, forgetting how unrepresentative they are.
For Britain, this is likely to be part of the explanation for peoples huge overestimates of how much the wealthiest own, how many young people are still living at home and what proportion of the population are immigrants (the guess is 25%, when it is really only 13%, according to of cial estimates).
As part of his series, If Our Bodies Could Talk, Hamblin, a relatively sane- looking man, took on a no-showering challenge to examine the effect of over-cleansing the body.
He reduced the number of showers he had and eliminated shampoo and soap when he did.
Showering destroys these happy bacterial colonies; theyre completely wiped out by all of our frequent rubbing and scrubbing.
And, when the bacteria washed off by soap repopulate, they tend to favour microbes which produce an odour  yes, too-frequent showering may actually make you smell more.
When you stop showering and using soap, however, your skin goes through an initial (likely gross) adjustment period, after which the skin typically restores balance, oil production slows and healthy bacteria  ourish.
Reducing the frequency of showers (and the number of cleansing products used) has very real implications for our environment.
Thats 65 litres of clean, drinkable water that were infusing with soap and washing down the drain each and every day  sometimes more than once.
In a speech at the British Science Festival, Dr Paul Kelley, clinical research associate at the Sleep and Circadian Neuroscience Institute at Oxford University, called for schools to stagger their starting times to work with the natural biological rhythms of their students.
It follows a paper, published in 2014, in which he noted that, when children are around ten, their biological wake-up time is about 6.30am; at 16, this rises to 8am; and, at 18, someone you may think of as a lazy teenager actually has a natural waking hour of 9am.
The conventional school starting time works for 10-year-olds but not 16- to 18-year-olds.
A 7am alarm call for older adolescents, Kelley and his colleagues pointed out in the paper, is the equivalent of a 4.30am start for a teacher in their 50s.
He says its not as simple as persuading teenagers to go to bed earlier.
Kelley says the working day should be more forgiving of our natural rhythms.
Should those in their 50s and above come in at 8am, while those in their 30s start at 10am and the teenage intern or apprentice be encouraged to turn up at 11am?
Its very uplifting in a way because its a solution that will make people less ill, and happier and better at what they do.
There would probably be fewer accidents as drivers would be more alert, he says.
It could spell the end of rush hour as people stagger their work and school-run times.
A later start to the day for many, says Kelley, is something that would bene t everyone, particularly families.
The Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) will  nally have regulations governing the commercial use of unmanned aircraft by June 2016.
But even short  ights from a mobile landing pad pose serious logistical problems, he said.
Theyre not proposing to deliver from one uninhabited place to another uninhabited place; theyre proposing to deliver from a warehouse to where the consumer is, which is likely an urban area or a suburban area, he said.
In those particular cases, there are going to be hazards along the way that the vehicle is going to have to detect.
Even then, maybe theres construction equipment that wasnt there but is there now.
Maybe GPS signals are blocked or partially blocked, in which case its going to have an incorrect idea about where it is.
Furthermore, you cant do everything with a 25kg aircraft, said Jay McConville, director of business development for unmanned systems at defence and business contractor Lockheed Martin MST.
He is working on a program that proposes using drones to inspect infrastructure  pipelines, telephone lines, bridges and so on.
Weve developed an exploration algorithm where you draw a box around an area and itll autonomously  y around that area and look at every surface and then report back.
If you  y commercial airlines, often theyll say, Oh, a component has failed  we have to go back to the gate, Singh said.
Part of the solution, Singh said, is simple contingency planning: If things fail, the vehicle has to do something reasonable. 
Maria is sitting on a black plastic chair in a community centre on a cold Tuesday afternoon waiting for her number to be called.
When its her turn, Maria is called forward to pick up a brown paper bag  lled with essentials including pasta, eggs and corn akes, and is invited to choose between butternut squash or carrots as this weeks vegetables.
Maria is the 34th client so far today at East Hampton Food Pantry, a community initiative set up just streets away from some of the most expensive and exclusive properties in the world.
In the summertime, the Hamptons, a collection of historic oceanfront towns and villages 100 miles from Manhattan, is a billionaires playground.
The people who come here are rich and famous but we who live here are not, says Maria, who works 14-hour days in the summer cleaning mansions but goes months without any work at all in the winter.
She says some families with up to  ve children are crammed into basements and still pay more than $1,000 a month in rent.
Lots of her friends cant pay for heating or medication and many would go hungry if it were not for the East Hampton Food Pantry, she says, which is just one of several food pantries in the town.
Vicki Littman, chairperson of the East Hampton Food Pantry, which provided more than 31,000 food parcels in 2015, says the number of people seeking out the food pantry is ever increasing.
Housing is, by far, the biggest cost in the Hamptons.
Cantwell says more than half the towns homes are empty for most of the year, which causes the population to dwindle to as little as 10,000 in the winter months compared with 80,000 in August.
Youve got to remember that this community was founded as a farming and  shing community of people who lived off the land and the water  a real working-class community.
"Its hard to really grasp  OK, the summer is coming to an end.
Vallone, who works cleaning pools and doing odd jobs on luxury estates, says that, if he saves well and doesnt impulse-buy, he can make his summer earnings stretch out until November.
There are worse things to do in life than stroll along Rios Copacabana beach in the sunshine on the way to watch a World Cup match, so it was perhaps not surprising that England fan Anthony McDowell from Liverpool was having none of the doom and gloom that preceded some of the build-up to the tournament in Brazil.
He and half a dozen friends are among the multitudes of supporters from around the world who have made the beachfront into a party zone of national colours and chants.
Some danced, some posed for photos, some drank, but mostly they just walked and talked football, waiting for the next game to begin on the nearby FanFest big screen.
The cheerful, largely peaceful mood was far from the protests, transport chaos and stadium problems that plagued preparations for the World Cup.
But, now the football is well and truly under way, visiting supporters are determined to enjoy the experience.
The trip has not been problem free.
And, they have been surprised that many bars are not set up with big screens for the games.
But, like many fans, they said they loved the atmosphere, if not the logistics, of this tournament which has got off to a spectacular start on the pitch.
Even the surliest cynic cannot have failed to be thrilled by Robin van Persies extraordinary diving header for the Netherlands against Spain.
Elsewhere, there has been a glut of goals: 28 in the  rst eight games  almost three times as many as at the same stage in South Africa in 2010.
The Globo newspaper listed a number of shortcomings in the 12 host cities.
The worst transport problems were in Natal, where bus drivers have been on strike since 12 June.
But, protests have diminished since the opening day, when small demonstrations took place in several cities, prompting police to use tear gas and pepper spray.
The tournament has made only a small mark on Sa_o Paulo, South Americas most populous city, but, far away in Manaus  the remote Amazonian city where England played Italy  visitors said World Cup fever was in full swing with brightly decorated streets and  ags  uttering on many cars.
But we were in Sao Paulo for four or  ve days in the run-up to the opening match and you wouldnt have known until the last day that there was even a World Cup on.
 It is not just the worlds biggest burger chain; it is also a global emblem of American consumer capitalism.
McDonalds has revealed that worldwide sales dropped by 3.3% on 2013 in a set of results that were described as atrocious.
In Europe, sales are down by 4%, mostly because of unrest in Ukraine and the sour anti-western mood in Russia.
But it is in the US, where McDonalds has around 40% of its restaurants, where the crisis runs deepest.
Almost 60 years after Ray Kroc opened his  rst restaurant in Des Plaines, Illinois, consumers are losing their appetite for a Big Mac and fries.
McDonalds has seen 12 straight months of declining sales in its massive home market, with sales down 4.1% in the latest quarter.
The number of 19-to-21-year-olds visiting McDonalds once a month has fallen by 13% since 2011, according to food analysts Technomic, while the number of 22-to-37-year- olds visiting has not grown.
McDonalds is also widely perceived as less healthy than most of its rivals, especially Chipotle, which trumpets its antibiotic-free meat and locally sourced, seasonal produce  although local for Chipotle can mean 350 miles away.
was one question on the Our Food Your Questions website  referring to the controversial beef  ller (gristle and fat) used for dog food that is sprayed with ammonia to make it  t for human consumption.
Yet, just as McDonalds has been losing the customers who will pay a bit more for food perceived as fresher and healthier, it has also lost its edge in fast-food essentials: speedy service at low prices.
The expensive tag was unjusti ed, said Mary Chapman at Technomic.
A competitive breakfast menu, improved coffee and free wi-  had given McDonalds a broad appeal in the UK, said Peter Martin of consultancy CGA Peach whose  gures show that 56% of British adults have visited a McDonalds restaurant at least once in the last six months.
Executives are promising to tackle misconceptions about its food in its home market.
Only four out of McDonalds 14,000 US restaurants had so far tested build your own burger, he said, raising questions about how it could be scaled up.
Meanwhile, despite the declining sales, the chain continues to expand globally: by the end of 2014, it expects to have opened 1,400 new restaurants.
We think it will be number one in terms of total sales for not just years but decades to come. 
The controversial catching and killing of sharks longer than three metres began after what the state government called an unprecedented number of shark attacks on Western Australias coast, which saw a 35-year-old surfer killed in November 2013.
Kate Faehrmann, a board member at the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, said from a protest in Perth: Weve been saying all along that this policy wont work.
This has demonstrated something about the national psyche, that, despite Jaws, despite all the fear, people are coming out in their thousands across the country to say, Thats their ocean.
Anthony Joyce, a surfer who once had his foot caught in a sharks mouth, said: The number of sharks they are going to kill is going to make no difference in the scheme of things.
The state government has refused to provide a running tally of sharks killed, though there have been reports of sharks smaller than three metres being released after getting caught on drumlines,  oating drums anchored to the sea bed with bait hanging on hooks beneath them.
Conservationists argue there is no evidence the cull will reduce the number of shark attacks on humans, as no previous cull has solely used drumlines.
Researchers at the University of Western Australia say the recent spate of shark attacks in the state may have more to do with the state having the fastest-growing population in Australia, rather than a rising number of sharks.
Richard Peirce, chairman of the UK-based conservation charity, the Shark Trust, said that the cull would be ineffective and potentially lure more predators towards the coast.
The indiscriminate nature of drumlines is often overlooked  even if monitored through the day, leaving the lines in overnight has the potential to attract other predators into the area, attracted by those sharks and other species hooked and injured.
Globally, in 2012, there were 80 unprovoked attacks by sharks, seven of which proved fatal, compared to nearly 100m sharks killed by humans each year.
RSPCA Australia released a statement saying it believes the cull is unjusti ed.
Rather, it is consistent with a changing population and human behaviour; that is, there are greater numbers of people in the water, it said.
Youre advertising a problem that doesnt exist in a major way and youre deterring people from wanting to come to Perth and your beautiful countryside around it.
What the job involves: A race engineer acts as the interpreter between the race-car mechanics and the driver, says race engineer Jamie Muir.
The engineer takes feedback from the driver, analyses the data available and makes decisions about the set-up needed for maximum performance, then relays this to the mechanics to instigate.
Ethical hacker Typical salary: 60,000 to 90,000 at team- leader level, while a newly quali ed hacker can expect a minimum salary of 35,000 to 50,000.
What the job involves: A company will pay an ethical hacker to hack into its computer system to see how well it might stand up to a real attack.
What the job involves: Descending to the sea bed and searching for unexploded ordnance (bombs, shells, grenades and landmines), then either safely recovering and collecting the weapons or securely disposing of them.
Quali cations: To dive offshore, you must have diving-inspection and medical-technician quali cations.
To be able to dispose of the bombs safely, youll also need an explosive ordnance disposal quali cation and years of experience.
The job: A social engineer is paid by a company to try to trick its employees into divulging con dential information that allows the engineer to access sensitive company data or the companys computer network.
Quali cations: A private-helicopter-pilot licence, a commercial pilots licence and around 2,000 hours of experience  ying at low levels in the type of helicopter the company usually uses.
To succeed as a power-line helicopter pilot, you need ... a steady hand and a cool head.
Butlers also suffer from isolation, cultural differences with their employer and having to work for people who arent always nice, says Sara Vestin, director of the British Butler Academy. 
Employees on zero-hours contracts often get no holiday or sick pay and have to ask permission before seeking additional work elsewhere.
And this needs to consider both the advantages and disadvantages in practice for businesses and employees.
Retailer Sports Direct recently became the focus of controversy on zero-hours when it emerged that the company employs around 20,000 of its 23,000 staff on the contracts.
The retailers use of the contracts was followed by details of a string of other companies using the deals, including cinema chain Cineworld and Buckingham Palace, which uses them for its 350 summer workers.
Pub group J D Wetherspoon has 24,000 of its staff  80% of its workforce  on the terms.
Vidhya Alakeson, from the Resolution Foundation, an independent think tank, added: If its true that there are around one million people on zero-hours contracts, then that would be a substantial portion of the workforce  this could no longer be dismissed as an issue affecting only a tiny minority.
Unions and poverty campaign groups have accused employers of pressuring staff into signing the contracts as a way to evade their responsibilities and cut staff bene ts.
They may give  exibility to a few, but the balance of power favours the employers and makes it hard for workers to complain.
Workers on zero-hours contracts are often only told how many hours they will work when weekly or monthly rotas are worked out, but are expected to be on call for extra work at short notice.
We believe zero-hours contracts are essential in our organization, as we are very weather- dependent, a spokeswoman said.
Our properties have told us its important to be able to reorganize staff rotas quickly to respond to the weather and zero-hours contracts allow us to do this.
The institutes  gures also suggest that 17% of employers in the private sector made use of zero- hours contracts, considerably lower than the 34% of organizations in the voluntary sector and 24% in the public sector.
Industries where employers were most likely to report at least one person on a zero-hours contract were hotels, catering and leisure (48%), education (35%) and healthcare (27%).
