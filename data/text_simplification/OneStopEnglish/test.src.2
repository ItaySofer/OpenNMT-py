The whole issue of climate change has to do with our economy of production and consumption being out of balance with what the Earth can provide, says van Otterdijk.
Production of food is one of the biggest production sectors in the world and, if one-third of all this is just produced in vain, you can imagine what a huge impact this has on the natural resources  on land, water, energy and greenhouse gas emissions.
The worst food waste offenders are the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, where consumers waste 39% of all food purchased, followed by Europe, where about 31% of all food purchased by consumers is thrown away.
This means that 11.7% of all food purchased is avoidably wasted, at an estimated cost to each family of 700 a year or almost 60 a month.
According to a nationwide analysis of food waste in UK households, the most wasted food in the UK by weight is bread, with consumers throwing away 414,000 tonnes (22.4%) of all bread purchased.
The UK has made progress in the past ten years, after a concerted campaign to reduce wastage.
Between 2007 and 2012, the amount of avoidable food waste produced by UK households decreased by 21%, from 5.3m tonnes to 4.2m tonnes, largely due to greater awareness.
Van Otterdijk says there has been a very encouraging, unexpected, continuing interest in the subject of food waste, enabling grass-roots campaigns around the world to gain momentum.
But if it continues like this, with the same momentum, maybe, after ten years, well have globally signi cant results. 
Clay Cockrell is sitting in his of ce at Columbus Circle, across the street from 1 Central Park West, which houses Trump International Hotel and Tower.
Cockrell, a former Wall Street worker turned therapist, spends large parts of his days walking through Central Park or the Battery Park in downtown Manhattan near Wall Street, as a con dant and counsellor to some of New Yorks wealthiest people.
So, what issues are Americas 1% struggling with?
And, then, there is the isolation  being in the 1%, it turns out, can be lonely.
The Occupy Wall Street movement was a good one and had some important things to say about income inequality but it singled out the 1% and painted them globally as something negative, said Jamie Traeger-Muney, a wealth psychologist and founder of the Wealth Legacy Group.
Traeger-Muney runs a global  rm and specializes in working with inheritors, who often get a bad reputation in the press.
You would never refer to another group of people in the way that it seems perfectly normal to refer to wealth holders.
Ironically, its harder to talk about having money than it is to talk about not having money.
According to research from Spectrem Group, in 2014, the number of US households with $1m or more in assets  excluding the value of their primary home  increased by 500,000 to 10.1m.
Since the 2008  nancial crisis, the income gap has expanded and the situation has gotten worse for the wealthy, Cockrell said.
Never being able to trust your friendships with people of different means, I think that is dif cult, said Cockrell.
These are real fears faced by the richest of the rich.
In 2007, the Gates Foundation teamed up with Boston Colleges Center on Wealth and Philanthropy to document what it felt like to be in Americas 1%.
For the next four years, researchers surveyed 165 of Americas richest households  120 of those households have at least $25m in assets.
The resulting study, The Joys and Dilemmas of Wealth, was 500 pages long and seemed to prove the old adage that money cant buy happiness.
Some Americans have taken to keeping their wealth secret.
There are a lot of people that are hiding their wealth because they are concerned about negative judgment, said Traeger-Muney.
Speaking in his soft, soothing voice that makes you want to spill all your worries, Cockrell said that a common mistake that many of his wealthy clients make is letting their money de ne them.
According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), there were just 41m subscribers using music streaming services globally in 2014.
Leaked information recently suggested that Apple is aiming to reach 100m subscribers, which, based on a subscription fee of $120 per year, would generate $12bn annually.
Apple is good at mainstreaming products but its not that good.
Apple managed to persuade consumers to pay for downloads and grew a huge business, which it dominated, with an estimated 70% market share.
Apple holds the lions share of this, making it the single biggest music retailer in the world.
But download revenue peaked in 2013 in the UK at 283m and fell to 249m in 2014.
The decline in download sales hit the US in 2013 so Apple bought Beats in 2014 for $3bn, not only to get into the premium headphone market, but also to make the transition from music ownership (downloads) to music access (subscription streaming).
Apple, and the record industry, cannot afford to get rid of the download market just yet  so streaming and downloading will have to coexist under the Apple brand, one representing the future as the other gets progressively slower and sicker.
The average spend of a music buyer in the UK in 2014, for example, was just 39.52, according to research.
Apple have previously tried to build an artist-friendly platform via iTunes.
They called it Ping and it didnt work.
There is the smell of revolution in the air and Apple is making sure its on the right side of the battle lines when they are drawn up.
This is going to be the interesting bit when the service actually goes live.
Getting exclusives for big albums is going to become crucial to streaming.
Apple will have been watching this carefully and making its own notes.
Nowadays, its lowest point, Piazza San Marco (only three feet above sea level) is inundated with water approximately 100 times annually.
In many parts of the world, the land is also sinking  in Venices case, subsoil compaction (a result of industrial exploitation of the surrounding area) lowered the city by 20cm between 1950 and 1970.
Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam is also sinking by about 2cm a year  but thats nothing compared to Jakarta, which is dropping 10 to 20cm annually.
Unfortunately for the Indonesian capital, it has pumped out so much groundwater to support its population that the land above is drying out and compacting, thereby creating a bowl.
While there are many plans to save Venice  and Ho Chi Minh City and Jakarta are taking the problem seriously  the same cannot be said for Miami, where politicians refuse to admit the city has a severe environmental problem.
The Florida resort lies less than ten feet above sea level; an increasing number of tropical storms are inundating the city; and it is built on porous limestone, which is absorbing the rising seawater.
This water then  lls the citys foundations and bubbles up through drains and pipes, forcing sewage upwards and polluting its fresh water.
In the Maldives, the populations of whole islands are now looking to abandon their homes.
The capital, Male_, population 153,379 and only four feet above sea level, has used Japanese investment to build a ten-foot sea wall at a cost of $63 million  but, long term, only a stabilization of rising sea levels will save it and the rest of the islands.
This city is just one example of a problem caused not so much by global warming as human over-expansion in the face of  nite resources.
Californias dream of farming the desert made sense while its total population remained around half a million (in 1870)  but, now, the state is home to 38 million people, who, between them, own 32 million vehicles and expect to be surrounded by lawns and golf courses.
The daily water use in Rancho Mirage is more than 200 gallons per person, which is giving rise to a man-made drought.
A 25% cut in water consumption has been implemented but this is unlikely to stabilize the resort, which is surrounded by sand and dust.
The long-term answer in Californias desert is likely to be the abandonment of some cities while consolidating the populations of others.
Fire is a growing threat to urban settlements in America  in fact, forest  res cause the most damage after severe storms, with 800 major  re disasters having been declared there between 1953 and 2014.
Many cities are  ghting a losing battle against the ravages of nature but is it possible to identify the worlds most vulnerable metropolis?
And, if they disappear, so does Males raison detre. 
Im ready to give up at 45 seconds but I push on through and it seems to get easier for a while.
By the end of the session, I think Id managed a prodigious 90 seconds of breath-holding, enough to let me swim a width.
I asked how she did it: very slow breathing for several minutes prior to each dive, then a big, deep breath before diving in.
Its even been said that humans have an ability to lower heart rate and metabolic rate in order to breath-hold for even longer.
And experimental evidence shows that heart rate doesnt drop during breath-holding.
This reduction in heart rate is just one of the physiological responses that are sometimes described together as the mammalian diving re ex.
While our ability to breath-hold may not be all that special, when we compare ourselves with other animals, its now proving very useful in one particular area of medicine.
Radiotherapy for breast cancer involves directing radiation, very precisely, at the tumour.
This may require several minutes worth of radiation and, so, its usually done in short bursts, between breaths.
But, if the patient can keep her chest perfectly still for several minutes, it means that the entire dose can be delivered, in the right place, in one go.
The problem, of course, is that most people, just like me, struggle to hold their breath for much longer than a minute.
When you breathe in, youre contracting the muscle of your diaphragm, pulling it  at so that the volume of your chest increases  and air is drawn into your lungs.
Arti cially raising oxygen levels and reducing carbon dioxide levels before a breath-hold, as in the Birmingham radiotherapy experiments, may work by delaying fatigue in the diaphragm.
First, there was the time he outraged prisoners of war by doubting the heroism of Vietnam veteran John McCain because he allowed himself to be captured.
As if PoWs, Fox News and women were not enemies enough, Trump has also insulted Mexican immigrants to the US, claimed that a Black Lives Matter protester who was violently ejected from a rally deserved to be roughed up, appeared to mock a New York Times journalist for his disability and falsely accused Muslim Americans of cheering on the 9/11 attackers.
But, he has nonetheless refused to retract any of the comments.
Some rivals still hope that, eventually, even Trumps supporters will tire of what critics view as his relentless attacks on minorities in particular.
As he delights in telling supporters, the three issues that he rails against most  immigration reform, free-trade deals and Barack Obamas national security policy  have become perhaps the de ning issues of the election.
might sound unrealistic but they have arguably destroyed the campaign hopes of Jeb Bush, who favours immigration reform.
Among Americans who identify as Republicans, current polls suggest he has 25-30% of the vote.
In the battle for hearts and minds, converting Trumps passionate supporters will be hard.
This scenario can be best understood by looking at responses to the question: Are there any of these candidates you would de nitely not support for the Republican nomination for president?
Steve Deace, a prominent Iowa conservative, said that Trumps antics are both a good and a bad thing.
On the other hand, it limits your ability to grow beyond that.
As the pollster notes: Trump says what theyre thinking and, the more outrageous he is, the more they agree with him.
That is certainly the feeling among ordinary  supporters who have attended his increasingly packed campaign events in recent months.
Sometimes life just isnt fair.
There have been arguments for years over who should of cially go down in history as the inventor of the ATM and, in 2005, a man called John Shepherd-Barron received a UK honour for services to banking as the inventor of the automatic cash dispenser.
But, the UK government is now saying it was Goodfellow who invented the ATM  so it would seem that, after all the squabbling, his place in history is now assured.
Back in the mid-1960s, Goodfellow was working as a development engineer and had been asked to devise a way to enable customers to withdraw cash from banks on Saturdays.
I set out to develop a cash-issuing machine and, to make this a reality, I invented the PIN [personal identi cation number] and an associated coded token.
His machine didnt use plastic cards  instead, it used cheques impregnated with carbon-14, a mildly radioactive substance.
It is widely accepted that the Shepherd-Barron ATM was the worlds  rst when it comes to being installed and used by the public; the  rst one, at a bank in north London, was opened on 27 June, 1967  a month before Goodfellows ATM made its public debut.
However, the patent for Goodfellows machine was lodged on 2 May, 1966, 14 months before the London ATM machine came into service.
That really stuck in my throat and I kicked up a bit of a fuss.
Shepherd-Barron is no longer alive to put his case but, in a 2005 interview, he was fairly withering about his rival: I dont know him but its clear that the difference between Goodfellow and us was that we thought through the whole system concept and that was important to the banks who bought it.
The website ATMInventor.com concludes: Who invented the idea of an ATM?
We have to think it was James Goodfellow in Scotland for holding a patent date of 1966. Who invented the ATM design we recognize today?
We think it was John D White for Docutel in the US.
So after all these years, Goodfellow  nally  nds himself being talked about in the same breath as John Logie Baird (the television), Alan Turing (the Turing machine), Sir Frank Whittle (the jet engine) and Sir Tim Berners-Lee (the World Wide Web).
Asked what he did with the 10 he received back in the 1960s, Goodfellow says he thinks he blew it on a wild night out, adding: It didnt change my life.
Our new international survey across 33 countries shows just how wrong the world is about a range of key social realities.
In Britain, people think that an extraordinary 43% of young adults aged 25-34 still live at home with their parents, rather than the actual 14%.
People also take mental shortcuts, where they grab for easily available information even if it doesnt quite  t the question.
Our study was mostly carried out through an online survey  and, in developing countries, this will be representative of a more af uent, connected group rather than the population as a whole.
But what we  nd, throughout the study, is that people grossly generalize from their own situations, forgetting how unrepresentative they are.
For Britain, this is likely to be part of the explanation for peoples huge overestimates of how much the wealthiest own, how many young people are still living at home and what proportion of the population are immigrants (the guess is 25%, when it is really only 13%, according to of cial estimates).
As part of his series, If Our Bodies Could Talk, Hamblin, a relatively sane- looking man, took on a no-showering challenge to examine the effect of over-cleansing the body.
He reduced the number of showers he had and eliminated shampoo and soap when he did.
Showering destroys these happy bacterial colonies; theyre completely wiped out by all of our frequent rubbing and scrubbing.
And, when the bacteria washed off by soap repopulate, they tend to favour microbes which produce an odour  yes, too-frequent showering may actually make you smell more.
When you stop showering and using soap, however, your skin goes through an initial (likely gross) adjustment period, after which the skin typically restores balance, oil production slows and healthy bacteria  ourish.
Reducing the frequency of showers (and the number of cleansing products used) has very real implications for our environment.
Thats 65 litres of clean, drinkable water that were infusing with soap and washing down the drain each and every day  sometimes more than once.
In a speech at the British Science Festival, Dr Paul Kelley, clinical research associate at the Sleep and Circadian Neuroscience Institute at Oxford University, called for schools to stagger their starting times to work with the natural biological rhythms of their students.
It follows a paper, published in 2014, in which he noted that, when children are around ten, their biological wake-up time is about 6.30am; at 16, this rises to 8am; and, at 18, someone you may think of as a lazy teenager actually has a natural waking hour of 9am.
The conventional school starting time works for 10-year-olds but not 16- to 18-year-olds.
A 7am alarm call for older adolescents, Kelley and his colleagues pointed out in the paper, is the equivalent of a 4.30am start for a teacher in their 50s.
He says its not as simple as persuading teenagers to go to bed earlier.
Kelley says the working day should be more forgiving of our natural rhythms.
Should those in their 50s and above come in at 8am, while those in their 30s start at 10am and the teenage intern or apprentice be encouraged to turn up at 11am?
Its very uplifting in a way because its a solution that will make people less ill, and happier and better at what they do.
There would probably be fewer accidents as drivers would be more alert, he says.
It could spell the end of rush hour as people stagger their work and school-run times.
A later start to the day for many, says Kelley, is something that would bene t everyone, particularly families.
The Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) will  nally have regulations governing the commercial use of unmanned aircraft by June 2016.
But even short  ights from a mobile landing pad pose serious logistical problems, he said.
Theyre not proposing to deliver from one uninhabited place to another uninhabited place; theyre proposing to deliver from a warehouse to where the consumer is, which is likely an urban area or a suburban area, he said.
In those particular cases, there are going to be hazards along the way that the vehicle is going to have to detect.
Even then, maybe theres construction equipment that wasnt there but is there now.
Maybe GPS signals are blocked or partially blocked, in which case its going to have an incorrect idea about where it is.
Furthermore, you cant do everything with a 25kg aircraft, said Jay McConville, director of business development for unmanned systems at defence and business contractor Lockheed Martin MST.
He is working on a program that proposes using drones to inspect infrastructure  pipelines, telephone lines, bridges and so on.
Weve developed an exploration algorithm where you draw a box around an area and itll autonomously  y around that area and look at every surface and then report back.
If you  y commercial airlines, often theyll say, Oh, a component has failed  we have to go back to the gate, Singh said.
Part of the solution, Singh said, is simple contingency planning: If things fail, the vehicle has to do something reasonable. 
Maria is sitting on a black plastic chair in a community centre on a cold Tuesday afternoon waiting for her number to be called.
When its her turn, Maria is called forward to pick up a brown paper bag  lled with essentials including pasta, eggs and corn akes, and is invited to choose between butternut squash or carrots as this weeks vegetables.
Maria is the 34th client so far today at East Hampton Food Pantry, a community initiative set up just streets away from some of the most expensive and exclusive properties in the world.
In the summertime, the Hamptons, a collection of historic oceanfront towns and villages 100 miles from Manhattan, is a billionaires playground.
The people who come here are rich and famous but we who live here are not, says Maria, who works 14-hour days in the summer cleaning mansions but goes months without any work at all in the winter.
She says some families with up to  ve children are crammed into basements and still pay more than $1,000 a month in rent.
Lots of her friends cant pay for heating or medication and many would go hungry if it were not for the East Hampton Food Pantry, she says, which is just one of several food pantries in the town.
Vicki Littman, chairperson of the East Hampton Food Pantry, which provided more than 31,000 food parcels in 2015, says the number of people seeking out the food pantry is ever increasing.
Housing is, by far, the biggest cost in the Hamptons.
Cantwell says more than half the towns homes are empty for most of the year, which causes the population to dwindle to as little as 10,000 in the winter months compared with 80,000 in August.
Youve got to remember that this community was founded as a farming and  shing community of people who lived off the land and the water  a real working-class community.
"Its hard to really grasp  OK, the summer is coming to an end.
Vallone, who works cleaning pools and doing odd jobs on luxury estates, says that, if he saves well and doesnt impulse-buy, he can make his summer earnings stretch out until November.
There are worse things to do in life than stroll along Rios Copacabana beach in the sunshine on the way to watch a World Cup match, so it was perhaps not surprising that England fan Anthony McDowell from Liverpool was having none of the doom and gloom that preceded some of the build-up to the tournament in Brazil.
He and half a dozen friends are among the multitudes of supporters from around the world who have made the beachfront into a party zone of national colours and chants.
Some danced, some posed for photos, some drank, but mostly they just walked and talked football, waiting for the next game to begin on the nearby FanFest big screen.
The cheerful, largely peaceful mood was far from the protests, transport chaos and stadium problems that plagued preparations for the World Cup.
But, now the football is well and truly under way, visiting supporters are determined to enjoy the experience.
The trip has not been problem free.
And, they have been surprised that many bars are not set up with big screens for the games.
But, like many fans, they said they loved the atmosphere, if not the logistics, of this tournament which has got off to a spectacular start on the pitch.
Even the surliest cynic cannot have failed to be thrilled by Robin van Persies extraordinary diving header for the Netherlands against Spain.
Elsewhere, there has been a glut of goals: 28 in the  rst eight games  almost three times as many as at the same stage in South Africa in 2010.
The Globo newspaper listed a number of shortcomings in the 12 host cities.
The worst transport problems were in Natal, where bus drivers have been on strike since 12 June.
But, protests have diminished since the opening day, when small demonstrations took place in several cities, prompting police to use tear gas and pepper spray.
The tournament has made only a small mark on Sa_o Paulo, South Americas most populous city, but, far away in Manaus  the remote Amazonian city where England played Italy  visitors said World Cup fever was in full swing with brightly decorated streets and  ags  uttering on many cars.
But we were in Sao Paulo for four or  ve days in the run-up to the opening match and you wouldnt have known until the last day that there was even a World Cup on.
 It is not just the worlds biggest burger chain; it is also a global emblem of American consumer capitalism.
McDonalds has revealed that worldwide sales dropped by 3.3% on 2013 in a set of results that were described as atrocious.
In Europe, sales are down by 4%, mostly because of unrest in Ukraine and the sour anti-western mood in Russia.
But it is in the US, where McDonalds has around 40% of its restaurants, where the crisis runs deepest.
Almost 60 years after Ray Kroc opened his  rst restaurant in Des Plaines, Illinois, consumers are losing their appetite for a Big Mac and fries.
McDonalds has seen 12 straight months of declining sales in its massive home market, with sales down 4.1% in the latest quarter.
The number of 19-to-21-year-olds visiting McDonalds once a month has fallen by 13% since 2011, according to food analysts Technomic, while the number of 22-to-37-year- olds visiting has not grown.
McDonalds is also widely perceived as less healthy than most of its rivals, especially Chipotle, which trumpets its antibiotic-free meat and locally sourced, seasonal produce  although local for Chipotle can mean 350 miles away.
was one question on the Our Food Your Questions website  referring to the controversial beef  ller (gristle and fat) used for dog food that is sprayed with ammonia to make it  t for human consumption.
Yet, just as McDonalds has been losing the customers who will pay a bit more for food perceived as fresher and healthier, it has also lost its edge in fast-food essentials: speedy service at low prices.
The expensive tag was unjusti ed, said Mary Chapman at Technomic.
A competitive breakfast menu, improved coffee and free wi-  had given McDonalds a broad appeal in the UK, said Peter Martin of consultancy CGA Peach whose  gures show that 56% of British adults have visited a McDonalds restaurant at least once in the last six months.
Executives are promising to tackle misconceptions about its food in its home market.
Only four out of McDonalds 14,000 US restaurants had so far tested build your own burger, he said, raising questions about how it could be scaled up.
Meanwhile, despite the declining sales, the chain continues to expand globally: by the end of 2014, it expects to have opened 1,400 new restaurants.
We think it will be number one in terms of total sales for not just years but decades to come. 
The controversial catching and killing of sharks longer than three metres began after what the state government called an unprecedented number of shark attacks on Western Australias coast, which saw a 35-year-old surfer killed in November 2013.
Kate Faehrmann, a board member at the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, said from a protest in Perth: Weve been saying all along that this policy wont work.
This has demonstrated something about the national psyche, that, despite Jaws, despite all the fear, people are coming out in their thousands across the country to say, Thats their ocean.
Anthony Joyce, a surfer who once had his foot caught in a sharks mouth, said: The number of sharks they are going to kill is going to make no difference in the scheme of things.
The state government has refused to provide a running tally of sharks killed, though there have been reports of sharks smaller than three metres being released after getting caught on drumlines,  oating drums anchored to the sea bed with bait hanging on hooks beneath them.
Conservationists argue there is no evidence the cull will reduce the number of shark attacks on humans, as no previous cull has solely used drumlines.
Researchers at the University of Western Australia say the recent spate of shark attacks in the state may have more to do with the state having the fastest-growing population in Australia, rather than a rising number of sharks.
Richard Peirce, chairman of the UK-based conservation charity, the Shark Trust, said that the cull would be ineffective and potentially lure more predators towards the coast.
The indiscriminate nature of drumlines is often overlooked  even if monitored through the day, leaving the lines in overnight has the potential to attract other predators into the area, attracted by those sharks and other species hooked and injured.
Globally, in 2012, there were 80 unprovoked attacks by sharks, seven of which proved fatal, compared to nearly 100m sharks killed by humans each year.
RSPCA Australia released a statement saying it believes the cull is unjusti ed.
Rather, it is consistent with a changing population and human behaviour; that is, there are greater numbers of people in the water, it said.
Youre advertising a problem that doesnt exist in a major way and youre deterring people from wanting to come to Perth and your beautiful countryside around it.
What the job involves: A race engineer acts as the interpreter between the race-car mechanics and the driver, says race engineer Jamie Muir.
The engineer takes feedback from the driver, analyses the data available and makes decisions about the set-up needed for maximum performance, then relays this to the mechanics to instigate.
Ethical hacker Typical salary: 60,000 to 90,000 at team- leader level, while a newly quali ed hacker can expect a minimum salary of 35,000 to 50,000.
What the job involves: A company will pay an ethical hacker to hack into its computer system to see how well it might stand up to a real attack.
What the job involves: Descending to the sea bed and searching for unexploded ordnance (bombs, shells, grenades and landmines), then either safely recovering and collecting the weapons or securely disposing of them.
Quali cations: To dive offshore, you must have diving-inspection and medical-technician quali cations.
To be able to dispose of the bombs safely, youll also need an explosive ordnance disposal quali cation and years of experience.
The job: A social engineer is paid by a company to try to trick its employees into divulging con dential information that allows the engineer to access sensitive company data or the companys computer network.
Quali cations: A private-helicopter-pilot licence, a commercial pilots licence and around 2,000 hours of experience  ying at low levels in the type of helicopter the company usually uses.
To succeed as a power-line helicopter pilot, you need ... a steady hand and a cool head.
Butlers also suffer from isolation, cultural differences with their employer and having to work for people who arent always nice, says Sara Vestin, director of the British Butler Academy. 
Employees on zero-hours contracts often get no holiday or sick pay and have to ask permission before seeking additional work elsewhere.
And this needs to consider both the advantages and disadvantages in practice for businesses and employees.
Retailer Sports Direct recently became the focus of controversy on zero-hours when it emerged that the company employs around 20,000 of its 23,000 staff on the contracts.
The retailers use of the contracts was followed by details of a string of other companies using the deals, including cinema chain Cineworld and Buckingham Palace, which uses them for its 350 summer workers.
Pub group J D Wetherspoon has 24,000 of its staff  80% of its workforce  on the terms.
Vidhya Alakeson, from the Resolution Foundation, an independent think tank, added: If its true that there are around one million people on zero-hours contracts, then that would be a substantial portion of the workforce  this could no longer be dismissed as an issue affecting only a tiny minority.
Unions and poverty campaign groups have accused employers of pressuring staff into signing the contracts as a way to evade their responsibilities and cut staff bene ts.
They may give  exibility to a few, but the balance of power favours the employers and makes it hard for workers to complain.
Workers on zero-hours contracts are often only told how many hours they will work when weekly or monthly rotas are worked out, but are expected to be on call for extra work at short notice.
We believe zero-hours contracts are essential in our organization, as we are very weather- dependent, a spokeswoman said.
Our properties have told us its important to be able to reorganize staff rotas quickly to respond to the weather and zero-hours contracts allow us to do this.
The institutes  gures also suggest that 17% of employers in the private sector made use of zero- hours contracts, considerably lower than the 34% of organizations in the voluntary sector and 24% in the public sector.
Industries where employers were most likely to report at least one person on a zero-hours contract were hotels, catering and leisure (48%), education (35%) and healthcare (27%).
