For his part, Carlos Davila, who works for the Spanish Ornithological Society in Donana, was also alarmed at the proposal.
This is a very, very bad idea indeed, he told me.
The trouble is that Spain does not have the public resources it possessed 16 years ago.
After the disaster, Spain woke up to the fact that it possessed a place of real ecological importance and did a lot to clean it up and protect it, he added.
It shows the power of Star Wars that, although they were disappointing, the prequels still managed to make a lot of money, said Rosser.
We may not yet be living in an age of  ying cars, as predicted in the 1985  lm Back to the Future II, but the rise of smartphones and other new technologies is creating a reality that is arguably as exciting and almost as far-fetched.
Communication between riders and drivers, between different vehicles and between cars and infrastructure is bringing transportation into a new era, according to Allan Clelland, an expert on transportation technology.
According to the study, those born in the 1990s are making 4% fewer car trips and travelling 18% fewer miles per year, on average, than members of previous generations did at the same stage in their lives.
Companies are working to develop technology that will enable a vehicle to tell traf c control systems not only that it is present but also where it is going and how fast it is travelling.
Automation Driverless cars have been in the headlines ever since Google began road testing the vehicles back in 2012 but no-one really knows when driverless cars will become commonplace.
To see what driverless cars might look like in action, go to the video at: vimeo.com/37751380.
The Mesolithic man, who lived in Spain around 7,000 years ago, had an unusual mix of blue eyes, black or brown hair and dark skin, according to analyses of his genetic make-up.
The Spanish team started their work after a group of cavers stumbled upon two skeletons in a deep and complex cave system high up in the Cantabrian Mountains of northwest Spain in 2006.
This guy had to be darker than any modern European, but we dont know how dark, the scientist said.
You see a lot of reconstructions of these people hunting and gathering and they look like modern Europeans with light skin.
You never see a reconstruction of a Mesolithic hunter-gatherer with dark skin and blue eye colour, Lalueza-Fox said.
The Spanish team went on to compare the genome of the hunter-gatherer to those of modern Europeans from different regions to see how they might be related.
But, in 2013, one of the mothers, who is 33 and unemployed, sued her ex-partner for maintenance for her daughter.
A DNA test was done and it was found it was not his baby and not her baby.
Its four years later: you can understand she doesnt want to give up her baby.
But, whatever happens, someone wont be happy.
Karabo Ngidi, a lawyer with the centre, said Whats going to happen must be in the best interests of the children.
In 1995, two mothers were awarded damages after their sons, born in 1989, were accidentally switched at the Johannesburg hospital where they were born.
Tourist numbers are down 80% this year, said Mayor Maria Kakali, in an of ce in the village where she grew up, home to around 200 people.
If we have to pay a tax of 23%, Im sorry to say it but we will all die on the island, says Kakali.
It has just over 3,000 beds for visitors, compared with tens of thousands on an island such as Rhodes.
The truth is the government doesnt pay much attention to the islands of the north Aegean, she said, so I would take all the kids from our school to the gates of parliament, to tell them: There is still life in these islands. 
The age of the big British summer music festival, including Glastonbury, is drawing to a close, according to the leading rock promoter and manager Harvey Goldsmith.
That is a big, big problem in our industry.
And, we are not producing a new generation of these kind of acts  the likes of the Rolling Stones, Muse, even the Arctic Monkeys  that can headline.
There were about 900 music festival events in the UK between May and September 2014, he said, and there is no way they can all continue.
He didnt want to risk leaving the US  it was him, not Elvis, said Goldsmith.
Freddie Mercury had to be our most powerful stage performer, the best live performer weve ever had.
Were not producing a new generation of this kind of act.
Coldplay is probably the last one to come up and that was ten years ago.
So, with no big acts to headline, there are no big shows.
What is it like to look at the very last of something?
If he does not mate successfully soon with one of two female northern white rhinos at Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya, there will be no more of their kind, male or female, born anywhere.
Apart from these three animals, there are only two other northern white rhinos in the world, both in zoos, both female.
His eye is a sad black dot in his massive wrinkled face as he wanders the reserve with his guards.
It is a majestic rectangle of strong bone and leathery  esh, a head that expresses pure strength.
Human beings  we always kill the things we love.
But the same people who painted such sensitive portraits of Ice Age rhinos helped to kill them off.
The northern white rhino is the rarest species of African rhino.
There are far greater numbers of southern white rhinos and black rhinos.
From 2007, when just 13 rhinos were killed by poachers in South Africa, the killings have grown horri cally.
In 2014, 1,215 rhinos were slaughtered for their horns in South Africa.
In 2006, the Irish designer completed a scuba-diving course and loved the feeling of being able to breathe underwater and observe  sh in their natural environment.
Although it allows you to stay underwater for longer, you have to plan your whole day around it.
You have 20kg to 50kg of gear with you  you cant be walking on the beach and decide you want to go in.
It was during a  nal-year project for his product design degree at the University of Limerick that Redmond produced the Express Dive.
The device can take in enough air for two minutes of diving and takes approximately the same amount of time to be re lled.
Redmond says the mouthpiece feels similar to using a snorkel.
The typical swimmer can hold their breath for about 40 seconds while underwater, he says.
A lot of my job is listening to peoples lives all day, every day and it started to feel so overwhelming to go on social media and see every single detail of everybodys life, including people that I dont really have a relationship with, she said.
One thing I really liked about Facebook was that I could sit for hours and click on a friend and then click on one of their friends and one of their friends and one of their friends and literally end up on someones Facebook page from the other side of the world, she said.
I wonder what it would be like if I didnt spend these seconds here and spent them doing something else.
He spends his lift rides and spare moments at work reading news articles and books rather than scrolling through a newsfeed.
And with no friends accounts to follow online, he has to pick up the phone and call them, something hes come to de nitely enjoy.
Lauren Raskauskas, 22, Naples, Florida Raskauskas describes herself as a pretty private person.
She recently deleted her Twitter account and deactivated her Facebook account two years ago after realizing she didnt like everyone knowing what I was doing.
He claims that he hasnt seen any effect at this point.
Even though classmates post about parties and events on Facebook, they make sure to send him a text message, too, he said.
His billing, The Beale Street Blues Boy, was shortened to Blues Boy King and thence to BB.
But he would also cite the earlier blues guitarists Blind Lemon Jefferson and Lonnie Johnson and the jazz players Charlie Christian and Django Reinhardt.
He once explained that his guitar technique was partly based on his lack of skill: I started to bend notes because I could never play in the bottleneck style, like Elmore James and Booker White.
About a year and a half ago, he said in 1969, all of a sudden, kids started coming up to me saying, Youre the greatest blues guitarist in the world.
Smokers are the key group for e-cigarette  rms because seven out of ten vapers are smokers.
Numbers who use e-cigarettes while continuing to smoke are going down, West said.
Weve only been tracking vaping for just over a year, so its a short time period, but we are not seeing growth in the number of long-term ex-smokers or never smokers using e-cigarettes.
Our customers are still very happy with the product, and technology and innovation in hardware is improving user experience and helping them to switch from traditional cigarettes.
They are more popular than nicotine patches and may or may not be more effective.
There is a tendency among some local authorities and organizations to treat e-cigarettes as cigarettes and ban them in public places and outdoors, he said.
Vienna is the worlds best city to live in, Baghdad is the worst and London, Paris and New York do not even make it into the top 35, according to international research into quality of life.
German-speaking cities dominate the rankings in the 18th Mercer Quality of Life study, with Vienna joined by Zurich, Munich, Dusseldorf and Frankfurt in the top seven.
You dont realize how safe Vienna is until you head abroad, said Hartlauer.
We also have terri c public transport, with the underground working 24 hours at weekends, and it only costs 1 per trip.
The fall of the Berlin Wall helped de ne Vienna as the hub for companies wanting to do business in Central Europe.
Zurich in Switzerland is named by Mercer as having the worlds second highest quality of life but the Viennese say their city is far more fun.
We asked waiters around the UK what they think of the tipping process (including how much they take home from tips and whether its fair) and what would improve it for them.
Rodri, 37, London: Around 50% of a waiters income is tips Average tips: 60 per eight-hour shift I think they treat waiters best in ... the US  Everything has got fairer since the tipping scandal was exposed in the summer of 2015.
However, you still hear horror stories from new employees at some chains.
I can average around 60 in tips per shift but, on a good night, this goes up to over 100 and, on a poor night, its around 40.
Elle, 22, Edinburgh: We never know whether its fair Average tips: 20 per eight-hour shift I think they treat waiters best in ... France  I work three jobs, all on part-time zero-hours contracts, in catering and hospitality.
In restaurants, because a lot of customers add tips through card payments, the staff never actually see how much is getting tipped  so we dont know whether were getting our fair share or not.
Its really unfair that tips go towards breakages made by customers.
The managers should have ways to pay for broken glasses and plates without docking our tips.
I make around 20 a shift but would only be given 10-15 of that money.
I really rely on tips because I am only paid 7 an hour.
Tom, Manchester: A big night of tips can help pay the rent Average tips: 40 per eight-hour shift I think they treat waiters best in ... Italy  Where I used to work,  oor staff kept 80% of cash tips and 40% of card tips.
Its hard to say how much I earned a shift; maybe around 40, 20 from card tips.
They have got tipping right in Italy, where people dont add a service charge but usually round up their bill so, if they get a meal for 19, they leave a 20 note and dont ask for change.
A more open and connected world is a better world.
You wont be surprised by an ex in the street with a new girlfriend or boyfriend: you already know theyre dating someone else from the romantic sel es.
It doesnt necessarily mean we see them the same way.
Professor Robin Dunbar is famous for his research that suggests a person can only have roughly 150 people as a social group.
An overwhelming majority of 91% post a photo of themselves, 71% post the city or town where they live, up from 61%, more than half give email addresses and a  fth give their phone number.
The data and analytics available to you are extraordinary.
4 Facebook has been the tool to organize revolutions Though the Arab Spring was dubbed the Twitter revolution, organizing demonstrations and direct action has been revolutionized by Facebook.
5 Facebook makes news, breaks news and decides what is news Roughly 71% of 18- to 24-year-olds say the internet is their main news source and 63% of users overall, according to the Pew Research Center.
And 39% are connected to people they have never met in person.
We may as well get used to it, said David Kirkpatrick, author of The Facebook Effect.
If the amount of food wasted around the world were reduced by just 25%, there would be enough food to feed all the people who are malnourished, according to the UN.
Each year, 1.3bn tonnes of food, about a third of all that is produced, is wasted, including about 45% of all fruit and vegetables, 35% of  sh and seafood, 30% of cereals, 20% of dairy products and 20% of meat.
In the developing world, food waste is virtually non-existent, says Robert van Otterdijk, coordinator of the UN Food and Agriculture Organizations Save Food programme.
Food waste is happening in countries where people can afford to throw away food.
The foods most commonly found in British bins are bread, vegetables, fruit and milk.
By percentage, the most wasted food is lettuce and leafy salads, of which consumers throw away 38% (64,000 tonnes) of all they buy.
Cockrell, a former Wall Street worker turned therapist, spends large parts of his days walking through Central Park or the Battery Park in downtown Manhattan near Wall Street, as a con dant and counsellor to some of New Yorks wealthiest people.
Many of the extremely wealthy  the 1% of the 1%  feel that their problems are really not problems.
There is the feeling that they have to hide the fact that they are rich.
And, then, there is the isolation  being in the 1%, it turns out, can be lonely.
The media, she said, is partly to blame for making the rich feel like they need to hide or feel ashamed.
Since the 2008  nancial crisis, the income gap has expanded and the situation has gotten worse for the wealthy, Cockrell said.
Never being able to trust your friendships with people of different means, I think that is dif cult, said Cockrell.
Some Americans have taken to keeping their wealth secret.
There are a lot of people that are hiding their wealth because they are concerned about negative judgment, said Traeger-Muney.
If you are part of the 1%, you still have problems and they are legitimate to you.
Money is not the only thing that de nes you, he said.
Is this the moment when streaming goes truly mainstream?
Apple is good at mainstreaming products but its not that good.
Apple, and the record industry, cannot afford to get rid of the download market just yet  so streaming and downloading will have to coexist under the Apple brand, one representing the future as the other gets progressively slower and sicker.
A century ago, Venice  one of the most beautiful and low-lying cities in the world  used to  ood around ten times a year.
I manage one minute and 12 seconds.
At a pool in Bristol, she taught me some simple exercises to help me hold my breath for longer while swimming underwater.
I asked how she did it: very slow breathing for several minutes prior to each dive, then a big, deep breath before diving in.
At least, it doesnt if youre breath-holding on land.
When you breathe in, youre contracting the muscle of your diaphragm, pulling it  at so that the volume of your chest increases  and air is drawn into your lungs.
Steve Deace, a prominent Iowa conservative, said that Trumps antics are both a good and a bad thing.
As the pollster notes: Trump says what theyre thinking and, the more outrageous he is, the more they agree with him.
Sometimes life just isnt fair.
In fact, he earned just 10 from the patent and has not made a penny more from it since.
The website ATMInventor.com concludes: Who invented the idea of an ATM?
In the section about great British inventions of the twentieth century, it states: In the 1960s, James Goodfellow (1937-) invented the cash-dispensing automatic teller machine (ATM) or cashpoint.
So after all these years, Goodfellow  nally  nds himself being talked about in the same breath as John Logie Baird (the television), Alan Turing (the Turing machine), Sir Frank Whittle (the jet engine) and Sir Tim Berners-Lee (the World Wide Web).
British people think the top 1% wealthiest households own 59% of their countrys wealth, when they actually only own 23%.
Americans think that 33% of their population are immigrants, when in fact it is only 14%.
In Britain, people think that an extraordinary 43% of young adults aged 25-34 still live at home with their parents, rather than the actual 14%.
The worst case is Saudi Arabia, where people think only 28% are, when 71% are.
Britons think it is 44%, when it is actually nearly half as much again  62% are either overweight or obese.
And, in many ways, it is not our misperceptions but these realities across different countries that are the most interesting and important aspects of the study.
Thats 65 litres of clean, drinkable water that were infusing with soap and washing down the drain each and every day  sometimes more than once.
The vital importance of clean water is becoming harder and harder to ignore, as California enters another summer of drought.
Skip a few showers, put down the soap and let those lovely little bacteria  ourish a little, would you? 
The conventional school starting time works for 10-year-olds but not 16- to 18-year-olds.
For the older teenagers, it might be more sensible to start the school day at 11am or even later.
Kelley says the working day should be more forgiving of our natural rhythms.
Describing the average sleep loss per night for different age groups, he says: Between 14 and 24, its more than two hours.
For people aged between 24 and about 30 or 35, its about an hour and a half.
Kelley says that synchronized hours could have many positive consequences.
The positive side of this is peoples performance, mood and health will improve.
Its very uplifting in a way because its a solution that will make people less ill, and happier and better at what they do.
A later start to the day for many, says Kelley, is something that would bene t everyone, particularly families.
And, yes, he says he  nds the start of his working day much easier now than he did when he was younger. 
Maybe GPS signals are blocked or partially blocked, in which case its going to have an incorrect idea about where it is.
One major problem is maintaining radio contact with a drone and planning for what happens if that contact breaks.
If you have a vehicle that can go into a neighbourhood, it can deliver from that base.
You need a 15-minute distance and typical off-the-shelf drones have about that distance.
The Reaper drone has one failure in 10,000 hours, Singh said.
Part of this is simply that air travel is inherently dangerous and, thus, standards are much higher.
Lots of her friends cant pay for heating or medication and many would go hungry if it were not for the East Hampton Food Pantry, she says, which is just one of several food pantries in the town.
Vicki Littman, chairperson of the East Hampton Food Pantry, which provided more than 31,000 food parcels in 2015, says the number of people seeking out the food pantry is ever increasing.
Housing is, by far, the biggest cost in the Hamptons.
Theres certainly a lot of wealth here but almost all of that wealth is in second homes only used in the summer, says Cantwell, the son of a  sherman father and a house-cleaner mother.
But, the rest of us live here year round.
There are famous and very wealthy people but then you have hard-working and poor people struggling to get by.
Youve got to remember that this community was founded as a farming and  shing community of people who lived off the land and the water  a real working-class community.
I want to work but theres no work to be done.
Some danced, some posed for photos, some drank, but mostly they just walked and talked football, waiting for the next game to begin on the nearby FanFest big screen.
The trip has not been problem free.
His son, Andrew, had his sunglasses stolen almost as soon as he sat on the beach.
And, they have been surprised that many bars are not set up with big screens for the games.
But, like many fans, they said they loved the atmosphere, if not the logistics, of this tournament which has got off to a spectacular start on the pitch.
Elsewhere, there has been a glut of goals: 28 in the  rst eight games  almost three times as many as at the same stage in South Africa in 2010.
The Globo newspaper listed a number of shortcomings in the 12 host cities.
The worst transport problems were in Natal, where bus drivers have been on strike since 12 June.
But, protests have diminished since the opening day, when small demonstrations took place in several cities, prompting police to use tear gas and pepper spray.
Since then, the only security threat has been petty theft and overexcited fans.
But, these days, the golden arches of McDonalds are looking a little tarnished.
Almost 60 years after Ray Kroc opened his  rst restaurant in Des Plaines, Illinois, consumers are losing their appetite for a Big Mac and fries.
The number of 19-to-21-year-olds visiting McDonalds once a month has fallen by 13% since 2011, according to food analysts Technomic, while the number of 22-to-37-year- olds visiting has not grown.
To add to the companys problems, McDonalds hamburgers were recently named the worst in America in a poll of more than 32,000 American  diners, who said they would rather eat a burger at Five Guys, Smashburger or Fuddruckers.
Have you ever used pink slime in your burgers?
Ever since it introduced $2 items on its dollar menu, it has gained a reputation for being more expensive than its rivals, while many consumers complain that service is slower.
Prices have indeed gone up but they havent gone up as quickly as the rest of the fast-service chains in the US.
McDonalds has a bigger menu than some, with more complicated items  its chicken McWrap takes 60 seconds to make.
Only four out of McDonalds 14,000 US restaurants had so far tested build your own burger, he said, raising questions about how it could be scaled up.
Faehrmann said the protests had shown Australians wanted sharks protected: Whats amazing is so many people in Australia love sharks.
Anthony Joyce, a surfer who once had his foot caught in a sharks mouth, said: The number of sharks they are going to kill is going to make no difference in the scheme of things.
Conservationists argue there is no evidence the cull will reduce the number of shark attacks on humans, as no previous cull has solely used drumlines.
Researchers at the University of Western Australia say the recent spate of shark attacks in the state may have more to do with the state having the fastest-growing population in Australia, rather than a rising number of sharks.
The activity in Western Australia is compounding the human tragedy of shark attacks.
Youre advertising a problem that doesnt exist in a major way and youre deterring people from wanting to come to Perth and your beautiful countryside around it.
All youre going to achieve, I think, is to worry people unnecessarily.

Retailer Sports Direct recently became the focus of controversy on zero-hours when it emerged that the company employs around 20,000 of its 23,000 staff on the contracts.
The retailers use of the contracts was followed by details of a string of other companies using the deals, including cinema chain Cineworld and Buckingham Palace, which uses them for its 350 summer workers.
Pub group J D Wetherspoon has 24,000 of its staff  80% of its workforce  on the terms.
Dave Prentis, of the trade union Unison, said: The vast majority of workers are only on these contracts because they have no choice.
The charity National Trust, which employs many of its seasonal workers on zero-hours contracts, said it offered the same pay and bene ts to those workers, pro rata, as full-time staff, but needed some workers to be on a more  exible arrangement.
Our properties have told us its important to be able to reorganize staff rotas quickly to respond to the weather and zero-hours contracts allow us to do this.
While some employees welcome the  exibility of such contracts, for many, zero-hours contracts leave them insecure and unsure of when work will come, he said.
The institutes  gures also suggest that 17% of employers in the private sector made use of zero- hours contracts, considerably lower than the 34% of organizations in the voluntary sector and 24% in the public sector.
Industries where employers were most likely to report at least one person on a zero-hours contract were hotels, catering and leisure (48%), education (35%) and healthcare (27%).
