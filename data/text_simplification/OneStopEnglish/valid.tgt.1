When they are not using their phones, 12- to 15-year-olds have a very different relationship with other media, too.
They spend 20% of their time watching short video clips, for example on YouTube, or news clips on Facebook and other social sites.
The rest of their viewing time is spent watching DVDs, streamed content through Net ix or iTunes and recorded television programmes.         
From 2006 to 2008, Duran took out 68 loans from 39 banks in Spain.
He spent two months in prison; then, they let him out on 50,000 bail.
They collected more than 25,000 kilos of dead  sh afterwards and nearly 2,000 adult birds, chicks, eggs and nests were killed or destroyed.
It was Spains worst environmental disaster and the clean-up cost 90 million.
There are riches here, riches that the local inhabitants badly need, said energy spokesman Vicente Fernandez Guerrero.
People have mined metals here since Roman times.
They will use the best technology in the world here, Fernandez said.
Carlos Davila, who works for the Spanish Ornithological Society in Donana, was also alarmed at the idea.
This is a very, very bad idea, he said.
The trouble is that Spain does not have the public resources it had 16 years ago.
After the disaster, Spain realized that it had a place of real ecological importance and did a lot to clean it up and protect it, he added.
It shows the power of Star Wars  the prequels were disappointing but they still made a lot of money, said Rosser.
We do not yet live in an age of  ying cars, as predicted in the 1985  lm Back to the Future II, but smartphones and other new technologies are creating exciting possibilities.
Communication between riders and drivers, between different vehicles and between cars and infrastructure is bringing transportation into a new era.
According to the study, people born in the 1990s are making 4% fewer car trips and travelling 18% fewer miles per year, on average, than older generations did at the same time in their lives.
Companies are developing technology that allows a vehicle to tell traf c control systems not only that it is present but also where it is going and how fast it is travelling.
Automation We have known about driverless cars ever since Google began testing the vehicles in 2012 but no-one really knows when driverless cars will become commonplace.
To see what driverless cars might look like on the road, go to the video at: vimeo.com/37751380.
The Mesolithic man, who lived in Spain about 7,000 years ago, had an unusual mix of blue eyes, black or brown hair and dark skin.
The Spanish team started their work after a group of cave explorers found two skeletons in a deep cave high up in the Cantabrian Mountains of northwest Spain in 2006.
This guy was darker than any modern European, but we dont know how dark, the scientist said.
You see a lot of pictures of these people hunting and gathering and they look like modern Europeans with light skin.
You never see a picture of a Mesolithic hunter-gatherer with dark skin and blue eyes, Lalueza-Fox said.
The Spanish team compared the hunter-gatherer to modern Europeans from different regions to see how they might be related.
In 2013, one of the mothers, who is 33 and unemployed, wanted her ex-partner to pay maintenance for her daughter.
They found that it was not his baby and not her baby.
She wants the baby back, but its four years later: you can understand that the other mother doesnt want to give up her baby, Strydom said.
Strydom added: Whatever happens, someone wont be happy.
Karabo Ngidi, a lawyer with the centre, said: We must do what is best for the children.
In 1995, two mothers were paid damages after their sons, born in 1989, were switched by mistake at the Johannesburg hospital where they were born.             
Tourist numbers have reduced by 80% this year, said Mayor Maria Kakali, in an of ce in the village where she grew up.
If we have to pay a tax of 23%, we will all die on the island, says Kakali.
It has just over 3,000 beds for visitors  Rhodes, for example, has tens of thousands of beds.
The government doesnt pay much attention to the islands of the north Aegean, she said, so I would take all the kids from our school to the gates of parliament, to tell them: There is still life in these islands.      
The age of the big British summer music festival, including Glastonbury, is ending, according to the top rock manager Harvey Goldsmith.
That is a big, big problem for us.
And we are not producing new bands that can headline  like the Rolling Stones, Muse, even the Arctic Monkeys.
There were about 900 music festivals in the UK between May and September in 2014, he said, and they cannot all continue.
He didnt want to risk leaving the US, said Goldsmith.
Freddie Mercury was our most powerful stage performer, the best live performer weve ever had.
Were not producing a new generation of this kind of band.
Coldplay is probably the last one and that was ten years ago.
"So, with no big bands to headline, there are no big shows.
What is it like to look at the last of something?
If he does not mate soon with one of two female northern white rhinos at Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya, there will be no more rhinos like them, male or female, born anywhere.
There are only two other northern white rhinos in the world, both in zoos, both female.
His eye is a sad black dot in his big face as he walks around the reserve with his guards.
It is a majestic rectangle of strong bone, a head of pure strength.
Human beings  we always kill the things we love.
But the same people who painted such sensitive pictures of Ice Age rhinos helped to kill them all.
The northern white rhino is the rarest kind of African rhino.
There are more southern white rhinos and black rhinos.
In 2007, 13 rhinos were killed by poachers in South Africa.
In 2014, 1,215 rhinos were killed for their horns in South Africa.
In 2006, the Irish designer completed a scuba-diving course and loved the feeling of being able to breathe underwater and watch  sh in their natural environment.
It allows you to stay underwater for longer but it takes a lot of planning.
You have 20kg to 50kg of gear with you  you cant just walk on the beach and decide you want to go in.
It was during a  nal-year project for his degree that Redmond produced the Express Dive.
The device can take in enough air for two minutes of diving and takes approximately the same amount of time to re ll.
Redmond says the mouthpiece feels similar to a snorkel.
The typical swimmer can hold their breath for about 40 seconds while underwater.
In my job, I spend a lot of time listening to peoples lives all day, every day and it started to feel too much to go on social media and see every detail of everybodys lives, including people that I dont know very well, she said.
One thing I really liked about Facebook was that I could sit for hours and click on a friend and then click on one of their friends and  nish on someones Facebook page from the other side of the world, she said.
I wonder what it would be like if I didnt spend this time here and spent it doing something else.
He spends his spare moments at work reading news articles and books.
And with no friends to follow online, he has to pick up the phone and call them, something he now enjoys.
Lauren Raskauskas, 22, Naples, Florida Raskauskas describes herself as a private person.
She has deleted her Twitter account and deleted her Facebook account two years ago when she realized that she didnt like everyone knowing what I was doing.
He says that he hasnt seen any effect at this point.
His classmates post about parties and events on Facebook but they send him a text message, too, he said.
He was known as The Beale Street Blues Boy but this was shortened to Blues Boy King and then to BB.
He also mentioned the earlier blues guitarists Blind Lemon Jefferson and Lonnie Johnson and the jazz players Charlie Christian and Django Reinhardt.
He once explained that his guitar technique was partly the result of his lack of skill: I started to bend notes because I could never play in the bottleneck style.
About a year and a half ago, he said in 1969, kids suddenly started saying to me, Youre the greatest blues guitarist in the world.
Smokers are the key group for e-cigarette companies because seven out of ten vapers are smokers.
The number of people who use e-cigarettes while continuing to smoke is going down, West said.
Weve only been studying vaping for just over a year, so its a short time period, but we are not seeing growth in the number of long-term ex-smokers or never smokers using e-cigarettes.
Our customers are still very happy with the product and technology is improving their experience and helping them to switch from traditional cigarettes.
They are more popular than nicotine patches but we do not know if they are more effective.
Some local authorities and organizations treat e-cigarettes like cigarettes  they ban them in public places and outdoors, he said.
Vienna is the worlds best city to live in, Baghdad is the worst and London, Paris and New York are not in the top 35, says an international study on quality of life.
German-speaking cities do well in the 18th Mercer Quality of Life study, with Vienna, Zurich, Munich, Dusseldorf and Frankfurt in the top seven.
You dont realize how safe Vienna is until you go abroad, said Hartlauer.
We also have terri c public transport  the underground trains run 24 hours at weekends and it only costs 1 per trip.
The fall of the Berlin Wall helped make Vienna a centre for companies who want to do business in Central Europe.
Mercer says Zurich in Switzerland has the worlds second highest quality of life but the Viennese say their city is far more fun.
We asked waiters around the UK what they think of tipping, including how much money they get from tips and if its fair.
Rodri, 37, London: Around 50% of a waiters income is tips Average tips: 60 per eight-hour shift I think they treat waiters best in ... the US  Everything has got fairer since the tipping scandal in the summer of 2015.
But you still hear horror stories from new employees at some chains.
On a good night, this goes up to over 100 and, on a poor night, its around 40.
Elle, 22, Edinburgh: We never know whether its fair Average tips: 20 per eight-hour shift I think they treat waiters best in ... France  I have three part-time jobs.
In restaurants, because a lot of customers add tips by card, the staff never see how much the tip is  so we dont know if what we get is fair or not.
Its really unfair that money from our tips is taken for breakages by customers.
The managers should have ways to pay for broken glasses and plates without taking our tips.
I make around 20 a shift in tips but often I only get 10-15 of that money.
I really need tips because I am only paid 7 an hour.
Tom, Manchester: A big night of tips can help pay the rent Average tips: 40 per eight-hour shift I think they treat waiters best in ... Italy  Where I used to work, waiters kept 80% of cash tips and 40% of card tips.
Its hard to say how much I earn in a shift; maybe about 40.
They have got tipping right in Italy, where customers dont add a big tip but usually round up their bill so, if their meal is 19, they leave a 20 note and dont ask for change.   
A more open and connected world is a better world, wrote Zuckerberg.
You wont be surprised if you see an ex in the street with a new girlfriend or boyfriend: you already know theyre with someone else because youve seen the romantic sel es.
It doesnt mean we see them the same way.
Professor Robin Dunbar is famous for his research that says a person can only have about 150 people in their social group.
Ninety-one per cent post a photo of themselves, 71% post the city or town where they live, more than half give email addresses and a  fth give their phone number.
The data available is extraordinary.
4 Facebook has been the tool to organize revolutions Organizing demonstrations has been revolutionized by Facebook.
5 Facebook makes news, breaks news and decides what is news About 71% of 18- to 24-year-olds and 63% of all users say they get news from the internet.
And 39% are connected to people they have never met.
David Kirkpatrick, author of The Facebook Effect, said that we need to get used to it.
If we reduced the amount of food we wasted around the world by just 25%, there would be enough food to feed all the hungry people in the world.
This includes about 45% of all fruit and vegetables, 35% of  sh and seafood, 30% of cereals, 20% of dairy products and 20% of meat.
In the developing world, there is almost no food waste, says Robert van Otterdijk, coordinator of the UN Food and Agriculture Organizations Save Food programme.
Food waste is happening in countries where people have more money, so they can throw away food.
The foods most often found in British bins are bread, vegetables, fruit and milk.
By percentage, the most wasted food is lettuce and leafy salads  people throw away 38% (64,000 tonnes) of all they buy.
He spends large parts of his days walking in Central Park or the Battery Park in downtown Manhattan near Wall Street, talking to some of New Yorks wealthiest people.
Many of the very wealthy  the 1% of the 1%  feel that their problems are really not problems.
There is the feeling that they have to hide that they are rich.
And, then, there is the isolation  being in the 1% can be lonely.
The media, she said, makes the rich feel like they need to hide or feel ashamed.
Since the 2008  nancial crisis, the gap between the rich and the poor has grown and the situation has gotten worse for the wealthy, Cockrell said.
Never being able to trust your friendships with other people, I think that is dif cult, said Cockrell.
Some Americans keep their wealth secret.
There are a lot of people hiding their wealth because they are worried about negative judgment, said Traeger-Muney.
If you are part of the 1%, you still have problems.
Money is not the only thing, he said.
Is this the moment when streaming goes mainstream?
Apple is good at making products go mainstream but its not that good.
Apple, and the record industry, cannot afford to get rid of the download market yet  so streaming and downloading will have to coexist under the Apple brand.
One hundred years ago, Venice  one of the most beautiful and low-lying cities in the world  used to  ood about ten times a year.
One minute and 12 seconds.
At a swimming pool in Bristol, she taught me some simple ways to help me hold my breath for longer while swimming underwater.
I asked how she did it: very slow breathing for several minutes before each dive, then a big, deep breath before diving in.
At least, it doesnt if youre doing it on land.
When you breathe in, youre pulling the muscle of your diaphragm  at so that the volume of your chest increases  this pulls the air into your lungs.
Steve Deace, an Iowa conservative, said that Trumps behaviour is both a good and a bad thing.
He says, Trump says what theyre thinking and, the more outrageous he is, the more they agree with him.
Life isnt fair sometimes.
In fact, he earned just 10 from the patent and has not made any money from it since.
The website ATMInventor.com says: Who invented the idea of an ATM?
In the section about great British inventions of the twentieth century, it says: In the 1960s, James Goodfellow (1937-) invented the automatic teller machine (ATM) or cashpoint.
So after all these years, Goodfellow is  nally among a group of famous British inventors with John Logie Baird (the television), Alan Turing (the Turing machine), Sir Frank Whittle (the jet engine) and Sir Tim Berners-Lee (the World Wide Web).
British people think the richest 1% own 59% of their countrys wealth, when they actually only own 23%.
Americans think that 33% of their population are immigrants but it is really only 14%.
In Britain, people think that 43% of young adults aged 25-34 still live at home with their parents, rather than the actual 14%.
The worst case is Saudi Arabia, where people think only 28% are overweight, when 71% are.
Britons think it is 44%, when actually 62% are overweight.
In many ways, it is the differences between countries that are the most interesting and important aspects of the study.
Thats 65 litres of clean, drinkable water that we  ll with soap and wash down the drain each and every day  sometimes more than once.
The importance of clean water is becoming harder and harder to ignore  for example, there is another summer of drought in California.
Shower less, put down the soap and let those lovely little bacteria  ourish. 
The normal school starting time works for 10-year-olds but not for 16- to 18-year-olds.
For the older teenagers, it might be better to start the school day at 11am or even later.
Kelley says the working day should be more linked to our natural rhythms.
Describing the average sleep loss per night for different age groups, he says: Between 14 and 24, people lose more than two hours.
For people aged between 24 and about 30 or 35, they lose about an hour and a half.
Kelley says that synchronized hours could have many positive effects.
The positive side is that peoples performance, mood and health will improve.
Its very positive because its a solution that will make people less ill, and happier and better at what they do.
A later start to the day for many, says Kelley, is something that would bene t all people, particularly families.
And, yes, he says he  nds the start of his working day much easier now than when he was younger. 
Maybe GPS signals will be blocked so its going to have an incorrect idea about where it is.
One big problem is keeping radio contact with a drone and planning for what happens if that contact breaks.
If you have a vehicle that can go into a neighbourhood, it can deliver from that vehicle.
You need a 15-minute distance, and typical drones have about that distance.
The Reaper drone, for example, has one failure in 10,000 hours, Singh said.
Part of the reason for this is simply that air travel is dangerous so standards are much higher.
Lots of her friends cant pay for heating or medicine and many would be hungry if they did not get food from the East Hampton Food Pantry, she says.
Vicki Littman, chairperson of the East Hampton Food Pantry, which gave more than 31,000 food parcels in 2015, says there are more and more people coming to the food pantry.
Housing is the biggest cost in the Hamptons.
Theres a lot of wealth here but almost all of that wealth is in second homes only used in the summer, says Cantwell, the son of a  sherman father and a house-cleaner mother.
But, the rest of us live here all year.
There are famous and very wealthy people but also hard-working and poor people.
Youve got to remember that this used to be a farming and  shing community  a real working-class community.
Vallone says, I want to work but theres no work.
Some danced, some took photos, some drank, but mostly they just walked and talked about football, waiting for the next game to begin on the big screen nearby.
The trip has not been without its problems.
His sons sunglasses were stolen almost as soon as he sat on the beach.
And, they have been surprised that many bars do not have big screens for the games.
But, like many fans, they said they loved the atmosphere of this tournament, which has had a spectacular start.
And, there have been lots of goals: 28 in the  rst eight games  almost three times as many as at the same stage in South Africa in 2010.
The Globo newspaper listed a number of problems in the 12 host cities.
The worst transport problems were in Natal, where bus drivers were on strike.
But, protests have happened less often since the opening day, when small demonstrations took place in several cities and police used pepper spray.
Since then, the only security problem has been petty theft and overexcited fans.
But, these days, the golden arches of McDonalds are not looking so golden.
Almost 60 years since Ray Kroc opened his  rst restaurant in Des Plaines, Illinois, consumers are losing their appetite for a Big Mac and fries.
The number of 19-to-21-year-olds who visit McDonalds once a month has fallen by 13% since 2011.
Another problem is that McDonalds hamburgers were recently named the worst in America in a poll of more than 32,000 American diners  they said they would rather eat a burger at Five Guys, Smashburger or Fuddruckers.
Someone asked Have you ever used pink slime in your burgers?
But, since it introduced $2 items on its dollar menu, people think it is more expensive than its rivals and many consumers complain that service is slower.
Prices have gone up but they havent gone up as quickly as the rest of the fast-food chains in the US.
McDonalds has a bigger menu than some other restaurants, with more complicated items  its chicken McWrap takes 60 seconds to make.
Only four out of McDonalds 14,000 US restaurants have tested build your own burger, he said.
Faehrmann said the protests showed that Australians wanted sharks to be protected: Whats amazing is that so many people in Australia love sharks.
Anthony Joyce, a surfer who once had his foot caught in a sharks mouth, said: The number of sharks they are going to kill is going to make no difference.
Conservationists say there is no evidence the cull will reduce the number of shark attacks on humans, because no other cull has only used drumlines.
Researchers at the University of Western Australia say the increased number of shark attacks in the state may be because Western Australia has the fastest-growing population in Australia, not because of a rising number of sharks.
The activity in Western Australia is adding to the human tragedy of shark attacks.
Youre advertising a problem that doesnt exist in a big way and youre going to stop people from wanting to come to Perth and your beautiful countryside around it.
All youre going to achieve, I think, is to worry people. 
Race engineer A race engineer takes information from the driver and gives it to the mechanics.
What the job involves: A race engineer is the interpreter between the race-car mechanics and the driver, says race engineer Jamie Muir.
Quali cations: A university degree, usually in automotive/mechanical engineering or motorsport technology.
To succeed as a race engineer, you need ... to be able to work under pressure.
Ethical hacker Typical salary: A newly quali ed hacker will usually have a minimum salary of 35,000 to 50,000.
What the job involves: A company pays an ethical hacker to hack into its computer system to see how well it might  ght a real attack.
Quali cations: You dont need a degree in computer science.
The industry accepts people with a very wide range of quali cations and skills.
Quali cations: To dive offshore, you must have diving quali cations.
To be able to dispose of the bombs safely, youll also need a special quali cation and years of experience.
To succeed as a bomb-disposal diver, you need ... to be calm in stressful situations.
Worst thing about the job: You will be away from home for at least six months of the year.
You also need to have strong personal ethics and to understand the law.
Quali cations: A private-helicopter-pilot licence, a commercial pilots licence and around 2,000 hours of experience  ying at low levels.
Pilots often have to  y next to the power line, sometimes as little as 20 feet away and just 30 feet off the ground.
The retail company Sports Direct employs around 20,000 of its 23,000 staff on zero-hours contracts.
Other companies using the contracts include cinema chain Cineworld and Buckingham Palace, which uses the contracts for its 350 summer workers.
Pub group J D Wetherspoon has 24,000 of its staff  80% of its workforce  on zero-hours contracts.
Dave Prentis, of the trade union Unison, said: The majority of workers are only on these contracts because they have no choice.
The charity National Trust, which employs many of its seasonal workers on zero-hours contracts, said it gives the same pay and bene ts to workers on zero-hours contracts as to full-time staff.
Its important to be able to reorganize staff rotas quickly to respond to the weather and zero-hours contracts allow us to do this.
Politician Chuka Umunna said, While some employees welcome the  exibility of zero-hours contracts, for many, zero-hours contracts leave them insecure and unsure of when work will come, he said.
The poll shows that 17% of employers in the private sector use zero-hours contracts, lower than the 34% of organizations in the voluntary sector and 24% in the public sector.
Industries where employers were most likely to have at least one person on a zero-hours contract were hotels, catering and leisure (48%), education (35%) and healthcare (27%).         
He gets what all referees want every time they referee a match.
A few weeks earlier, Riley, Dunn and another former referee, Peter Jones, went to another level-5 match to check another young referee  John Brooks.
A little later, the football club secretary arrived to pay the officials for their time  the match fee at level 5 is 95 so it is clear that these men do not do it for the money.
How does he feel when he watches football on TV and a referee is attacked?
Riley, as a young referee, bought himself books on psychology and nutrition because there was no information on offer to him at all.
Riley, as a young referee, bought himself books on psychology and nutrition because there was no information on offer to him at all.
He also has the support of a sports psychologist and an exercise regime to help him run 11km during a game.
It makes the referees job better and makes them more effective on the field of play, says Riley.
Buildings warm up in different ways.
The Stanford mirror re ects 97% of the visible light that falls on it.
When the mirror is warmed up, it releases heat at a speci c wavelength of infrared light that goes easily through the atmosphere and out into space.
You could use the mirrors on buildings and spend much less money on air conditioning or maybe you wouldnt need it at all.
You could put the mirrors on top of shopping malls.     
The project is a key part of Moroccos plans to use its deserts to become a global solar superpower.
When they are  nished, the four plants at Ouarzazate will be as big as Moroccos capital city, Rabat, and make 580 mega-watts of electricity, enough for a million homes.
Solar energy will make up a third of Moroccos renewable energy supply by 2020.
Exporting solar energy could have stabilizing effects within and between countries, according to the Moroccan solar energy agency (Masen).
We believe that its possible to export energy to Europe but,  rst, we have to build the connections, which dont yet exist, said Maha el-Kadiri, a Masen spokeswoman.
In three years, the number of paying subscribers rose from 8 million to 28 million, according to the 2014 digital music report from the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI).
Subscription services are easily accessible from smartphones and tablets, so they are popular with people who want to try out new music without buying a download or a CD.
Retailers are becoming increasingly aware that shoppers who visit a physical store want a service and an experience they cant get online, says Simon Boydell, spokesman for Marketforce, which has more than 300,000 mystery shoppers.
Our clients want to know how well their stores are delivering on that experience.
Each day, they spend up to eight hours visiting  ve to ten stores, plus another hour or two writing detailed reports on every part of their visit.
Mystery shoppers are usually repaid any money they spend in the stores and may also be allowed to keep the products they buy.
Im always given a speci c task, such as buying something from a speci c department or a new product range, but I can often buy whatever I want  and keep it.
She earns around 30,000 to 40,000 a year and that doesnt include all the freebies she gets on the job.
She  nds it satisfying to return to a store where she has previously been a mystery shopper and see standards have improved.
Marketforce shoppers usually get a couple of pounds for a visit, for their time and effort, says Boydell.
I wont do those jobs anymore.
Hannah, a 41-year-old lawyer, has made nearly 500 visits for the Mystery Dining Company in her spare time without receiving pay or travel expenses.
When the Russian capsule opened, he felt the cool air of Kazakhstan and smelled a smell like a plant was blooming in that area.
He said the message we need to save the planet was slightly wrong: The planet will get better; its us that wont be here because well destroy the environment.
A single brain spot contains a number of related words.
And, each single word appears in many different brain spots.
It is possible that we could use this technology to decode information about what words a person is hearing, reading or possibly even thinking, said Alexander Huth, the main author of the study.
Each person heard about 25,000 words  and more than 3,000 different words  as they lay in the scanner.
The atlas shows how words and related terms use the same regions of the brain.
The same region responds to killed and murdered.
On the brains right-hand side, near the top of the head, is one of the brain spots used for family terms: wife, husband, children, parents.
Each word is represented by more than one spot because words often have many meanings.
One part of the brain, for example, is used for the word top and also for other words that describe clothes.
One of them is for numbers and measurements, another for buildings and places.
But, the scientists only scanned  ve men and two women.
It is highly possible that people from different backgrounds and cultures will have different brain atlases.
If they force people outside the bar to smoke, it is going to increase the tension thats already there.
Martha Wood lives beside a loud bar that has live music.
I couldnt ban smoking in my bar without a ban in the whole city, says Douville.
Neil Timms owns an English pub and saw a smoking ban before, in England.
To avoid the same problems, hes spending money to build a patio.
But Douville feels the ban could be a great business opportunity.
There are lots of people who would enjoy coming to our bar but they never came because they didnt want to smell like smoke for the next seven days  now, those people can come.
Councilwoman LaToya Cantrell, who introduced the ban, disagrees: The responsibility is on the bar-owner to keep their customers respectful outside as well, she says.
The owners need to tell them to go and have a smoke but be respectful to their communities.
We can have clean air without noise problems  I think its about communication and creating partnerships between the communities and the businesses.
Bar customers must  ll out a form or call 311 and include photographs of illegal smoking.
Geoff Douville says that hes used to noise complaints.
But it doesnt mean theyre going to win.       
This learned deafness is a real problem, Fristrup told the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in San Jose.
We are training ourselves to ignore the information that comes into our ears.
This gift that we are born with  the ability to hear things hundreds of metres away, all these incredible sounds  might be lost, he said.
For the past ten years, the US National Park Service has recorded sound levels at more than 600 parks in the US, including Yosemite in California, Yellowstone and Denali in Alaska.
If  nding peace and quiet becomes too dif cult, many children will grow up without the experience and I think its a very big problem, he said.
Speaking at the same meeting, Derrick Taff, a social scientist at Pennsylvania State University, said that listening to recordings from national parks, of waterfalls, birdsong and wind, helped people feel less stressed.
Valter Piscedda, the mayor of Elmas, a small town near Sardinias capital, Cagliari, wants to pay residents to leave.
This idea comes from common sense and experience, he told the Guardian.
Others have tried everything and, now, they want to go and gain work experience abroad; life experience, too.
In Elmas, the scheme has got mixed reactions.
There is little work here, said Alessandro Macis.
said Consuelo Melis, who works in a local cafe.
But Piscedda says, The work I can create, as mayor, is temporary.
Robert Mys_ajek stops.
There are now about 1,500 wolves in Poland.
The wolf, the brown bear, the lynx and the wolverine are Europes last large predator carnivores.
DNA tests have shown that Polish wolves are travellers.
Mys_ajek says only the need to save forests and control the wild animal population can save Europes wild carnivores, especially the unpopular wolf.
In 1989, when the communists left power, Poland had only one motorway.
The Environment Minister, Jan Szyszko, is a hunter.
You cant say to the politicians that wolves are a big tourist attraction.
Tom Sanders, a professor of nutrition at Kings College London, said the research showed some differences.
The results of the research are based on an analysis of 343 studies from around the world  more than ever before  which examine differences between organic and regular fruit, vegetables and cereals.
Leifert and his colleagues conclude that many antioxidants reduce the risk of serious diseases, including diseases of the heart and certain cancers.
The researchers also found much higher levels of cadmium, a toxic metal, in regular crops.
Another criticism of the research is that the differences it found may be the result of different climates, different types of soil and different types of crops; they may not be the result of organic farming.
Browning said: This research supports what people think about organic food.
In other countries, there is much more support and acceptance of the bene ts of organic food and farming.
The canoe is our island, the crew is the community and the navigator is the leader, he says.
On a canoe, you are not just going from one place to another using the stars, the moon, the sun and the birds.
It is a partnership between the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Oceania Regional Of ce and  ve Paci c Island countries: Samoa, Tonga, New Zealand, the Cook Islands and Fiji.
The main aim of the 11,000km trip was to deliver a special message to the World Parks Congress.
According to the IUCN, in 2013, less than three per cent of the worlds oceans was in marine protected areas and less than one per cent of that is no take (no  shing).
And climate change is already having a serious effect on Paci c Islanders.
I work hard and am good at my job but, when PizzaExpress thinks it can take a percentage of our tips, I get upset.
Restaurant chains Ask and Zizzi also deduct 8% of the tips paid by card.
Cafe_ Rouge, Bella Italia and Belgo deduct 10%; Strada and Giraffe do, too.
Almost 6,000 people have signed Unites online petition.
He doesnt work for PizzaExpress but has worked for 11 years for another restaurant chain.
The way clouds affect global warming has been the biggest mystery in the study of future climate change.
4C would be catastrophic, not simply dangerous, Sherwood said.
For example, it would make life difficult, if not impossible, in much of the tropics and it would guarantee the eventual melting of the Greenland ice sheet and some of the Antarctic ice sheet.
When water evaporates from the oceans, the vapour can rise over nine miles to form rain clouds that reflect sunlight; or, it may rise just a few miles and fall slowly back down without forming clouds.
Climate sceptics like to criticize climate models because they are sometimes wrong, and we know that they are not perfect, said Sherwood.
But we are finding that the mistakes are being made by the models that predict less warming, not the models that predict more warming.
Even in successful countries such as Indonesia and Vietnam, the proportion was 20%.
His income has fallen slowly, because of his illness and his wifes illness, the cost of his sons marriage, the death of his father and loss of goods such as  shing nets.
Lovemore, from Zimbabwe, is now one of the poorest people in his village.

Even Nigeria, with its oil wealth, spends only $650 per person, Shepherd said.
It is a beer brewed by women that anyone can drink, she says.
One weekend they created the recipe; the next weekend they brewed 1,600 litres.
This beer is not aimed at women, says Thomas Bingebo, the head brewer at Ocean.
Other breweries have already asked FemAle if they can brew new beers with them.
From all across Rwanda, and even from Burundi, people are coming to the southern town of Butare to a little shop called Inzozi Nziza (Sweet Dreams).
Here, at the central African countrys  rst ice-cream shop, customers can buy ice cream in sweet cream, passion fruit, strawberry and pineapple  avours.
Ice cream is important, she says between mouthfuls of honey- avoured ice cream.
The shop can certainly make dreams come true.
The shop is uniting people here, Kalisa Migendo, a 24-year-old student, says.
Inzozi Nziza was opened by Odile Gakire Katese.
Some are survivors of the 1994 genocide, when almost a million Tutsis and Hutus were killed.

Schools should teach navigation and map reading, he wrote.
We studied a group of current London taxi drivers and a group of retired London taxi drivers, said Dr Hugo Spiers of University College London, who is an author of the study.
The way we use navigation technology also has an impact on our own abilities, says Spiers.
McKinlay believes humans must still able to take control of their navigation.
La premiere chose quon regarde (The First Thing We Look At) by Gregoire Delacourt is the story of a French model who looks so similar to the American actor that the books main male character thinks she is Johansson.
In the novel, the models beauty means that men see her only as a sex object and women are jealous of her.
She has many adventures as Johansson and, in the end, dies in a car crash.
Delacourt is one of Frances best-loved authors; his last novel, My List of Desires, was translated into 47 languages and they are making a  lm of it.
I wrote a real love story about womens beauty, especially interior beauty.
I thought she might send me  owers because the book was a declaration of love for her, but she didnt understand, Delacourt said.       
All were tested between 2007 and 2010 on three different things: stamina, handgrip strength and lower-body power.
The results showed that a childs month of birth could make big differences to their levels of  tness, muscle strength and ability to accelerate, all of which predict how good someone is at sport.
Children born in October were almost as  t  they scored highest for strength and came third for power, with December children close behind.
The gap in physical ability between children in the same class but born in different months was sometimes very wide.
This is a huge physical advantage, said Sandercock.
These gaps could decide who became a top-level athlete because selection into elite sports may often depend on very small differences in a persons physical performance.
The  ndings seem to show that children born in the early months of the school year enjoy a double autumn advantage  we already know that they have an academic advantage and, now, they also seem to be better at sport, too.
Children that get a high-quality  rst experience will have greater agility, balance and coordination, and are more likely to develop an enjoyment of physical activity and be good at sport as they grow up, he said.
As soon as the children at a primary school in Stirling, Scotland, hear the words daily mile, they leave the classroom and start running around the school  eld.
For three-and-a-half years, all the pupils at St Ninians Primary School have walked or run a mile each day.
The thought of children across the country running every day because of something weve done is amazing.
Just in Stirling, 30 schools have already started or are going to start the daily mile.
The most important thing is that the children really enjoy it.
At St Ninians, teachers take their pupils out of lessons to the schools playing  eld for their daily mile at a time that suits that days timetable.
Researchers from Stirling University have begun a study to look for evidence of the physical, cognitive and emotional bene ts of the daily mile.
Paralympian, Tanni Grey-Thompson, chair of ukactive, a health organization for physical activity, said: All children need to achieve 60 active minutes every day  this can be in a lesson, on the walk to school or in the playground.
We know sitting still kills; not sitting still helps children build skills that will help them for the rest of their lives.
The Scottish government also supports the idea.
His team found meningitis at Times Square, a trace of anthrax on a train carriage and bacteria that cause plague on a rubbish bin and ticket machine at stations in uptown Manhattan.
All around the subway, there were bacteria from cheeses  brie, cheddar, parmesan and the mozzarella found on New York pizza.
The bacteria of Swiss cheese were found in midtown Manhattan and the  nancial district, and the bacteria used to make kimchi and sauerkraut showed up in the  nancial district and Bay Ridge.
Bacteria that cause diarrhoea and nausea, as well as E.coli, and the bacteria that can cause skin infections and urinary-tract infections were common all over the city.
He said he hoped the research would help health of cials to prevent and track diseases.       
The yes campaign had four big successes  it won 53% of the vote in Scotlands largest city, Glasgow, 57% in Dundee and 51% in North Lanarkshire.
We have heard the voice of Scotland and, now, we must hear the millions of voices of England, he said.
Ed Miliband, the leader of the Labour Party, said the referendum was a vote from the Scottish people for change.
We know our country needs to change.
Theyve not been a part of this for the last 18 years.
We will continue to  ght with the facts because the facts are on our side, he said.

Stratford was important to Shakespeare all his life, says Paul Edmondson, the head of learning and research at the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust.
But Stratford is where he bought land and houses, where he kept his library, where he lived and read and thought.
The anniversary of the death of the man from Stratford, the most famous and the most performed playwright in the world, will be celebrated across Britain and the world.
There will be performances of Macbeth in Singapore and Romeo and Juliet in Brussels.
In London, they are also creating a 37-screen pop-up cinema, one screen to show each of Shakespeares plays.
The National Theatre, the Royal Shakespeare Company and almost every other theatre production company in the country will celebrate the anniversary.
There will also be hundreds of lectures, international conferences,  lms, concerts, operas and major exhibitions.
Shakespeare was famous in his own lifetime but there is little documentary evidence about Shakespeares life and times.
The actor Mark Rylance has called the First Folio his favourite book in the world and most of the surviving First Folios will be on display  including those that belong to the British and Bodleian libraries, and a copy recently discovered in France.
The general public and many academics have underestimated the importance of Stratford to Shakespeare.
Hearing a salmons click is probably one of the most dif cult things a killer whale does.
It is harder to hear that click if theres a lot of noise around you.
The researchers used underwater microphones to measure the noise made by about 1,600 ships as they passed through Haro Strait, in Washington State, USA.
The two-year study recorded the sound made by 12 different types of ship, including cruise ships, container ships and military ships, that passed through the strait about 20 times a day.
Some ships are quieter than others but the average noise next to all the ships was 173 underwater decibels, the same as 111 decibels through the air  about the sound of a loud rock concert.
Whales are not usually right next to ships and so would hear noise of about 60 to 90 decibels  around the level of a vacuum cleaner.
Most noise is at that low frequency but there is more background noise in the high frequencies, too.
Reducing speed by six knots could decrease noise by half.
A quarter of women also pressed the shock button.
The report from psychologists at Virginia and Harvard Universities looks at the question of why most of us  nd it so hard to do nothing.
The only rules were that they had to stay sitting and not fall asleep.
Most of them did not enjoy the experience.
But 12 of 18 men gave themselves electric shocks and six of 24 women gave themselves electric shocks.
Imagine  a person is told to sit in a chair with wires attached to their skin and a button that will give them a harmless but uncomfortable shock, and they are told to just sit there with their thoughts, she said.
When you enter a department store, cameras are watching you.
We need to know what characteristics this shopper has and that, when those characteristics are present, this is what a person usually does.
If it sounds familiar, its because the internet has been using techniques like these for years.
If I just showed you a photo of someones body, you could probably tell me what gender they are.
We allow this to happen online so why not in shops?
In 6- to 7-year-olds, who have grown up with YouTube, Spotify music streaming and online television, the average DQ score was 98.
The biggest change is in time spent talking on the phone.
But, now, for children aged 12 to 15, phone calls make up just 3% of time spent communicating through any device.
For all adults, this rises to 20% and, for young adults, it is 9%.
When they are not using their phones, 12- to 15-year-olds have a very different relationship with other media, too.
They spend 20% of their time watching short video clips, for example on YouTube, or news clips on Facebook and other social sites.
The rest of their viewing time is spent watching DVDs, streamed content through Net ix or iTunes and recorded television programmes.         
From 2006 to 2008, Duran took out 68 loans from 39 banks in Spain.
He spent two months in prison; then, they let him out on 50,000 bail.
They collected more than 25,000 kilos of dead  sh afterwards and nearly 2,000 adult birds, chicks, eggs and nests were killed or destroyed.
It was Spains worst environmental disaster and the clean-up cost 90 million.
There are riches here, riches that the local inhabitants badly need, said energy spokesman Vicente Fernandez Guerrero.
People have mined metals here since Roman times.
They will use the best technology in the world here, Fernandez said.
Carlos Davila, who works for the Spanish Ornithological Society in Donana, was also alarmed at the idea.
This is a very, very bad idea, he said.
The trouble is that Spain does not have the public resources it had 16 years ago.
After the disaster, Spain realized that it had a place of real ecological importance and did a lot to clean it up and protect it, he added.
It shows the power of Star Wars  the prequels were disappointing but they still made a lot of money, said Rosser.
We do not yet live in an age of  ying cars, as predicted in the 1985  lm Back to the Future II, but smartphones and other new technologies are creating exciting possibilities.
Communication between riders and drivers, between different vehicles and between cars and infrastructure is bringing transportation into a new era.
According to the study, people born in the 1990s are making 4% fewer car trips and travelling 18% fewer miles per year, on average, than older generations did at the same time in their lives.
Companies are developing technology that allows a vehicle to tell traf c control systems not only that it is present but also where it is going and how fast it is travelling.
Automation We have known about driverless cars ever since Google began testing the vehicles in 2012 but no-one really knows when driverless cars will become commonplace.
To see what driverless cars might look like on the road, go to the video at: vimeo.com/37751380.
The Mesolithic man, who lived in Spain about 7,000 years ago, had an unusual mix of blue eyes, black or brown hair and dark skin.
The Spanish team started their work after a group of cave explorers found two skeletons in a deep cave high up in the Cantabrian Mountains of northwest Spain in 2006.
This guy was darker than any modern European, but we dont know how dark, the scientist said.
You see a lot of pictures of these people hunting and gathering and they look like modern Europeans with light skin.
You never see a picture of a Mesolithic hunter-gatherer with dark skin and blue eyes, Lalueza-Fox said.
The Spanish team compared the hunter-gatherer to modern Europeans from different regions to see how they might be related.
In 2013, one of the mothers, who is 33 and unemployed, wanted her ex-partner to pay maintenance for her daughter.
They found that it was not his baby and not her baby.
She wants the baby back, but its four years later: you can understand that the other mother doesnt want to give up her baby, Strydom said.
Strydom added: Whatever happens, someone wont be happy.
Karabo Ngidi, a lawyer with the centre, said: We must do what is best for the children.
In 1995, two mothers were paid damages after their sons, born in 1989, were switched by mistake at the Johannesburg hospital where they were born.             
Tourist numbers have reduced by 80% this year, said Mayor Maria Kakali, in an of ce in the village where she grew up.
If we have to pay a tax of 23%, we will all die on the island, says Kakali.
It has just over 3,000 beds for visitors  Rhodes, for example, has tens of thousands of beds.
The government doesnt pay much attention to the islands of the north Aegean, she said, so I would take all the kids from our school to the gates of parliament, to tell them: There is still life in these islands.      
The age of the big British summer music festival, including Glastonbury, is ending, according to the top rock manager Harvey Goldsmith.
That is a big, big problem for us.
And we are not producing new bands that can headline  like the Rolling Stones, Muse, even the Arctic Monkeys.
There were about 900 music festivals in the UK between May and September in 2014, he said, and they cannot all continue.
He didnt want to risk leaving the US, said Goldsmith.
Freddie Mercury was our most powerful stage performer, the best live performer weve ever had.
Were not producing a new generation of this kind of band.
Coldplay is probably the last one and that was ten years ago.
"So, with no big bands to headline, there are no big shows.
What is it like to look at the last of something?
If he does not mate soon with one of two female northern white rhinos at Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya, there will be no more rhinos like them, male or female, born anywhere.
There are only two other northern white rhinos in the world, both in zoos, both female.
His eye is a sad black dot in his big face as he walks around the reserve with his guards.
It is a majestic rectangle of strong bone, a head of pure strength.
Human beings  we always kill the things we love.
But the same people who painted such sensitive pictures of Ice Age rhinos helped to kill them all.
The northern white rhino is the rarest kind of African rhino.
There are more southern white rhinos and black rhinos.
In 2007, 13 rhinos were killed by poachers in South Africa.
In 2014, 1,215 rhinos were killed for their horns in South Africa.
In 2006, the Irish designer completed a scuba-diving course and loved the feeling of being able to breathe underwater and watch  sh in their natural environment.
It allows you to stay underwater for longer but it takes a lot of planning.
You have 20kg to 50kg of gear with you  you cant just walk on the beach and decide you want to go in.
It was during a  nal-year project for his degree that Redmond produced the Express Dive.
The device can take in enough air for two minutes of diving and takes approximately the same amount of time to re ll.
Redmond says the mouthpiece feels similar to a snorkel.
The typical swimmer can hold their breath for about 40 seconds while underwater.
In my job, I spend a lot of time listening to peoples lives all day, every day and it started to feel too much to go on social media and see every detail of everybodys lives, including people that I dont know very well, she said.
One thing I really liked about Facebook was that I could sit for hours and click on a friend and then click on one of their friends and  nish on someones Facebook page from the other side of the world, she said.
I wonder what it would be like if I didnt spend this time here and spent it doing something else.
He spends his spare moments at work reading news articles and books.
And with no friends to follow online, he has to pick up the phone and call them, something he now enjoys.
Lauren Raskauskas, 22, Naples, Florida Raskauskas describes herself as a private person.
She has deleted her Twitter account and deleted her Facebook account two years ago when she realized that she didnt like everyone knowing what I was doing.
He says that he hasnt seen any effect at this point.
His classmates post about parties and events on Facebook but they send him a text message, too, he said.
He was known as The Beale Street Blues Boy but this was shortened to Blues Boy King and then to BB.
He also mentioned the earlier blues guitarists Blind Lemon Jefferson and Lonnie Johnson and the jazz players Charlie Christian and Django Reinhardt.
He once explained that his guitar technique was partly the result of his lack of skill: I started to bend notes because I could never play in the bottleneck style.
About a year and a half ago, he said in 1969, kids suddenly started saying to me, Youre the greatest blues guitarist in the world.
Smokers are the key group for e-cigarette companies because seven out of ten vapers are smokers.
The number of people who use e-cigarettes while continuing to smoke is going down, West said.
Weve only been studying vaping for just over a year, so its a short time period, but we are not seeing growth in the number of long-term ex-smokers or never smokers using e-cigarettes.
Our customers are still very happy with the product and technology is improving their experience and helping them to switch from traditional cigarettes.
They are more popular than nicotine patches but we do not know if they are more effective.
Some local authorities and organizations treat e-cigarettes like cigarettes  they ban them in public places and outdoors, he said.
Vienna is the worlds best city to live in, Baghdad is the worst and London, Paris and New York are not in the top 35, says an international study on quality of life.
German-speaking cities do well in the 18th Mercer Quality of Life study, with Vienna, Zurich, Munich, Dusseldorf and Frankfurt in the top seven.
You dont realize how safe Vienna is until you go abroad, said Hartlauer.
We also have terri c public transport  the underground trains run 24 hours at weekends and it only costs 1 per trip.
The fall of the Berlin Wall helped make Vienna a centre for companies who want to do business in Central Europe.
Mercer says Zurich in Switzerland has the worlds second highest quality of life but the Viennese say their city is far more fun.
We asked waiters around the UK what they think of tipping, including how much money they get from tips and if its fair.
Rodri, 37, London: Around 50% of a waiters income is tips Average tips: 60 per eight-hour shift I think they treat waiters best in ... the US  Everything has got fairer since the tipping scandal in the summer of 2015.
But you still hear horror stories from new employees at some chains.
On a good night, this goes up to over 100 and, on a poor night, its around 40.
Elle, 22, Edinburgh: We never know whether its fair Average tips: 20 per eight-hour shift I think they treat waiters best in ... France  I have three part-time jobs.
In restaurants, because a lot of customers add tips by card, the staff never see how much the tip is  so we dont know if what we get is fair or not.
Its really unfair that money from our tips is taken for breakages by customers.
The managers should have ways to pay for broken glasses and plates without taking our tips.
I make around 20 a shift in tips but often I only get 10-15 of that money.
I really need tips because I am only paid 7 an hour.
Tom, Manchester: A big night of tips can help pay the rent Average tips: 40 per eight-hour shift I think they treat waiters best in ... Italy  Where I used to work, waiters kept 80% of cash tips and 40% of card tips.
Its hard to say how much I earn in a shift; maybe about 40.
They have got tipping right in Italy, where customers dont add a big tip but usually round up their bill so, if their meal is 19, they leave a 20 note and dont ask for change.   
A more open and connected world is a better world, wrote Zuckerberg.
You wont be surprised if you see an ex in the street with a new girlfriend or boyfriend: you already know theyre with someone else because youve seen the romantic sel es.

Professor Robin Dunbar is famous for his research that says a person can only have about 150 people in their social group.
Ninety-one per cent post a photo of themselves, 71% post the city or town where they live, more than half give email addresses and a  fth give their phone number.
The data available is extraordinary.
4 Facebook has been the tool to organize revolutions Organizing demonstrations has been revolutionized by Facebook.
5 Facebook makes news, breaks news and decides what is news About 71% of 18- to 24-year-olds and 63% of all users say they get news from the internet.
And 39% are connected to people they have never met.
David Kirkpatrick, author of The Facebook Effect, said that we need to get used to it.
If we reduced the amount of food we wasted around the world by just 25%, there would be enough food to feed all the hungry people in the world.
This includes about 45% of all fruit and vegetables, 35% of  sh and seafood, 30% of cereals, 20% of dairy products and 20% of meat.
In the developing world, there is almost no food waste, says Robert van Otterdijk, coordinator of the UN Food and Agriculture Organizations Save Food programme.
Food waste is happening in countries where people have more money, so they can throw away food.
The foods most often found in British bins are bread, vegetables, fruit and milk.
By percentage, the most wasted food is lettuce and leafy salads  people throw away 38% (64,000 tonnes) of all they buy.
He spends large parts of his days walking in Central Park or the Battery Park in downtown Manhattan near Wall Street, talking to some of New Yorks wealthiest people.
Many of the very wealthy  the 1% of the 1%  feel that their problems are really not problems.
There is the feeling that they have to hide that they are rich.
And, then, there is the isolation  being in the 1% can be lonely.
The media, she said, makes the rich feel like they need to hide or feel ashamed.
Since the 2008  nancial crisis, the gap between the rich and the poor has grown and the situation has gotten worse for the wealthy, Cockrell said.
Never being able to trust your friendships with other people, I think that is dif cult, said Cockrell.
Some Americans keep their wealth secret.
There are a lot of people hiding their wealth because they are worried about negative judgment, said Traeger-Muney.
If you are part of the 1%, you still have problems.
Money is not the only thing, he said.
Is this the moment when streaming goes mainstream?
Apple is good at making products go mainstream but its not that good.
Apple, and the record industry, cannot afford to get rid of the download market yet  so streaming and downloading will have to coexist under the Apple brand.

At a swimming pool in Bristol, she taught me some simple ways to help me hold my breath for longer while swimming underwater.
I asked how she did it: very slow breathing for several minutes before each dive, then a big, deep breath before diving in.
At least, it doesnt if youre doing it on land.
When you breathe in, youre pulling the muscle of your diaphragm  at so that the volume of your chest increases  this pulls the air into your lungs.
Steve Deace, an Iowa conservative, said that Trumps behaviour is both a good and a bad thing.
He says, Trump says what theyre thinking and, the more outrageous he is, the more they agree with him.
Life isnt fair sometimes.
In fact, he earned just 10 from the patent and has not made any money from it since.
The website ATMInventor.com says: Who invented the idea of an ATM?
In the section about great British inventions of the twentieth century, it says: In the 1960s, James Goodfellow (1937-) invented the automatic teller machine (ATM) or cashpoint.
So after all these years, Goodfellow is  nally among a group of famous British inventors with John Logie Baird (the television), Alan Turing (the Turing machine), Sir Frank Whittle (the jet engine) and Sir Tim Berners-Lee (the World Wide Web).
British people think the richest 1% own 59% of their countrys wealth, when they actually only own 23%.
Americans think that 33% of their population are immigrants but it is really only 14%.
In Britain, people think that 43% of young adults aged 25-34 still live at home with their parents, rather than the actual 14%.
The worst case is Saudi Arabia, where people think only 28% are overweight, when 71% are.
Britons think it is 44%, when actually 62% are overweight.
In many ways, it is the differences between countries that are the most interesting and important aspects of the study.
Thats 65 litres of clean, drinkable water that we  ll with soap and wash down the drain each and every day  sometimes more than once.
The importance of clean water is becoming harder and harder to ignore  for example, there is another summer of drought in California.
Shower less, put down the soap and let those lovely little bacteria  ourish. 
The normal school starting time works for 10-year-olds but not for 16- to 18-year-olds.
For the older teenagers, it might be better to start the school day at 11am or even later.
Kelley says the working day should be more linked to our natural rhythms.
Describing the average sleep loss per night for different age groups, he says: Between 14 and 24, people lose more than two hours.
For people aged between 24 and about 30 or 35, they lose about an hour and a half.
Kelley says that synchronized hours could have many positive effects.
The positive side is that peoples performance, mood and health will improve.
Its very positive because its a solution that will make people less ill, and happier and better at what they do.
A later start to the day for many, says Kelley, is something that would bene t all people, particularly families.
And, yes, he says he  nds the start of his working day much easier now than when he was younger. 
Maybe GPS signals will be blocked so its going to have an incorrect idea about where it is.
One big problem is keeping radio contact with a drone and planning for what happens if that contact breaks.
If you have a vehicle that can go into a neighbourhood, it can deliver from that vehicle.
You need a 15-minute distance, and typical drones have about that distance.
The Reaper drone, for example, has one failure in 10,000 hours, Singh said.
Part of the reason for this is simply that air travel is dangerous so standards are much higher.
Lots of her friends cant pay for heating or medicine and many would be hungry if they did not get food from the East Hampton Food Pantry, she says.
Vicki Littman, chairperson of the East Hampton Food Pantry, which gave more than 31,000 food parcels in 2015, says there are more and more people coming to the food pantry.
Housing is the biggest cost in the Hamptons.
Theres a lot of wealth here but almost all of that wealth is in second homes only used in the summer, says Cantwell, the son of a  sherman father and a house-cleaner mother.
But, the rest of us live here all year.
There are famous and very wealthy people but also hard-working and poor people.
Youve got to remember that this used to be a farming and  shing community  a real working-class community.
Vallone says, I want to work but theres no work.
Some danced, some took photos, some drank, but mostly they just walked and talked about football, waiting for the next game to begin on the big screen nearby.
The trip has not been without its problems.
His sons sunglasses were stolen almost as soon as he sat on the beach.
And, they have been surprised that many bars do not have big screens for the games.
But, like many fans, they said they loved the atmosphere of this tournament, which has had a spectacular start.
And, there have been lots of goals: 28 in the  rst eight games  almost three times as many as at the same stage in South Africa in 2010.
The Globo newspaper listed a number of problems in the 12 host cities.
The worst transport problems were in Natal, where bus drivers were on strike.
But, protests have happened less often since the opening day, when small demonstrations took place in several cities and police used pepper spray.
Since then, the only security problem has been petty theft and overexcited fans.
