You also need to have strong personal ethics and to understand the law.
Quali cations: A private-helicopter-pilot licence, a commercial pilots licence and around 2,000 hours of experience  ying at low levels.
Pilots often have to  y next to the power line, sometimes as little as 20 feet away and just 30 feet off the ground.
The retail company Sports Direct employs around 20,000 of its 23,000 staff on zero-hours contracts.
Other companies using the contracts include cinema chain Cineworld and Buckingham Palace, which uses the contracts for its 350 summer workers.
Pub group J D Wetherspoon has 24,000 of its staff  80% of its workforce  on zero-hours contracts.
Dave Prentis, of the trade union Unison, said: The majority of workers are only on these contracts because they have no choice.
The charity National Trust, which employs many of its seasonal workers on zero-hours contracts, said it gives the same pay and bene ts to workers on zero-hours contracts as to full-time staff.
Its important to be able to reorganize staff rotas quickly to respond to the weather and zero-hours contracts allow us to do this.
Politician Chuka Umunna said, While some employees welcome the  exibility of zero-hours contracts, for many, zero-hours contracts leave them insecure and unsure of when work will come, he said.
The poll shows that 17% of employers in the private sector use zero-hours contracts, lower than the 34% of organizations in the voluntary sector and 24% in the public sector.
Industries where employers were most likely to have at least one person on a zero-hours contract were hotels, catering and leisure (48%), education (35%) and healthcare (27%).         
He gets what all referees want every time they referee a match.
A few weeks earlier, Riley, Dunn and another former referee, Peter Jones, went to another level-5 match to check another young referee  John Brooks.
A little later, the football club secretary arrived to pay the officials for their time  the match fee at level 5 is 95 so it is clear that these men do not do it for the money.
How does he feel when he watches football on TV and a referee is attacked?
Riley, as a young referee, bought himself books on psychology and nutrition because there was no information on offer to him at all.
Riley, as a young referee, bought himself books on psychology and nutrition because there was no information on offer to him at all.
He also has the support of a sports psychologist and an exercise regime to help him run 11km during a game.
It makes the referees job better and makes them more effective on the field of play, says Riley.
Buildings warm up in different ways.
The Stanford mirror re ects 97% of the visible light that falls on it.
When the mirror is warmed up, it releases heat at a speci c wavelength of infrared light that goes easily through the atmosphere and out into space.
You could use the mirrors on buildings and spend much less money on air conditioning or maybe you wouldnt need it at all.
You could put the mirrors on top of shopping malls.     
The project is a key part of Moroccos plans to use its deserts to become a global solar superpower.
When they are  nished, the four plants at Ouarzazate will be as big as Moroccos capital city, Rabat, and make 580 mega-watts of electricity, enough for a million homes.
Solar energy will make up a third of Moroccos renewable energy supply by 2020.
Exporting solar energy could have stabilizing effects within and between countries, according to the Moroccan solar energy agency (Masen).
We believe that its possible to export energy to Europe but,  rst, we have to build the connections, which dont yet exist, said Maha el-Kadiri, a Masen spokeswoman.
In three years, the number of paying subscribers rose from 8 million to 28 million, according to the 2014 digital music report from the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI).
Subscription services are easily accessible from smartphones and tablets, so they are popular with people who want to try out new music without buying a download or a CD.
Retailers are becoming increasingly aware that shoppers who visit a physical store want a service and an experience they cant get online, says Simon Boydell, spokesman for Marketforce, which has more than 300,000 mystery shoppers.
Our clients want to know how well their stores are delivering on that experience.
Each day, they spend up to eight hours visiting  ve to ten stores, plus another hour or two writing detailed reports on every part of their visit.
Mystery shoppers are usually repaid any money they spend in the stores and may also be allowed to keep the products they buy.
Im always given a speci c task, such as buying something from a speci c department or a new product range, but I can often buy whatever I want  and keep it.
She earns around 30,000 to 40,000 a year and that doesnt include all the freebies she gets on the job.
She  nds it satisfying to return to a store where she has previously been a mystery shopper and see standards have improved.
Marketforce shoppers usually get a couple of pounds for a visit, for their time and effort, says Boydell.
I wont do those jobs anymore.
Hannah, a 41-year-old lawyer, has made nearly 500 visits for the Mystery Dining Company in her spare time without receiving pay or travel expenses.
When the Russian capsule opened, he felt the cool air of Kazakhstan and smelled a smell like a plant was blooming in that area.
He said the message we need to save the planet was slightly wrong: The planet will get better; its us that wont be here because well destroy the environment.
A single brain spot contains a number of related words.
And, each single word appears in many different brain spots.
It is possible that we could use this technology to decode information about what words a person is hearing, reading or possibly even thinking, said Alexander Huth, the main author of the study.
Each person heard about 25,000 words  and more than 3,000 different words  as they lay in the scanner.
The atlas shows how words and related terms use the same regions of the brain.
The same region responds to killed and murdered.
On the brains right-hand side, near the top of the head, is one of the brain spots used for family terms: wife, husband, children, parents.
Each word is represented by more than one spot because words often have many meanings.
One part of the brain, for example, is used for the word top and also for other words that describe clothes.
One of them is for numbers and measurements, another for buildings and places.
But, the scientists only scanned  ve men and two women.
It is highly possible that people from different backgrounds and cultures will have different brain atlases.
If they force people outside the bar to smoke, it is going to increase the tension thats already there.
Martha Wood lives beside a loud bar that has live music.
I couldnt ban smoking in my bar without a ban in the whole city, says Douville.
Neil Timms owns an English pub and saw a smoking ban before, in England.
To avoid the same problems, hes spending money to build a patio.
But Douville feels the ban could be a great business opportunity.
There are lots of people who would enjoy coming to our bar but they never came because they didnt want to smell like smoke for the next seven days  now, those people can come.
Councilwoman LaToya Cantrell, who introduced the ban, disagrees: The responsibility is on the bar-owner to keep their customers respectful outside as well, she says.
The owners need to tell them to go and have a smoke but be respectful to their communities.
We can have clean air without noise problems  I think its about communication and creating partnerships between the communities and the businesses.
Bar customers must  ll out a form or call 311 and include photographs of illegal smoking.
Geoff Douville says that hes used to noise complaints.
But it doesnt mean theyre going to win.       
This learned deafness is a real problem, Fristrup told the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in San Jose.
We are training ourselves to ignore the information that comes into our ears.
This gift that we are born with  the ability to hear things hundreds of metres away, all these incredible sounds  might be lost, he said.
For the past ten years, the US National Park Service has recorded sound levels at more than 600 parks in the US, including Yosemite in California, Yellowstone and Denali in Alaska.
If  nding peace and quiet becomes too dif cult, many children will grow up without the experience and I think its a very big problem, he said.
Speaking at the same meeting, Derrick Taff, a social scientist at Pennsylvania State University, said that listening to recordings from national parks, of waterfalls, birdsong and wind, helped people feel less stressed.
Valter Piscedda, the mayor of Elmas, a small town near Sardinias capital, Cagliari, wants to pay residents to leave.
This idea comes from common sense and experience, he told the Guardian.
Others have tried everything and, now, they want to go and gain work experience abroad; life experience, too.
In Elmas, the scheme has got mixed reactions.
There is little work here, said Alessandro Macis.
said Consuelo Melis, who works in a local cafe.
But Piscedda says, The work I can create, as mayor, is temporary.
Robert Mys_ajek stops.
There are now about 1,500 wolves in Poland.
The wolf, the brown bear, the lynx and the wolverine are Europes last large predator carnivores.
DNA tests have shown that Polish wolves are travellers.
Mys_ajek says only the need to save forests and control the wild animal population can save Europes wild carnivores, especially the unpopular wolf.
In 1989, when the communists left power, Poland had only one motorway.
The Environment Minister, Jan Szyszko, is a hunter.
You cant say to the politicians that wolves are a big tourist attraction.
Tom Sanders, a professor of nutrition at Kings College London, said the research showed some differences.
The results of the research are based on an analysis of 343 studies from around the world  more than ever before  which examine differences between organic and regular fruit, vegetables and cereals.
Leifert and his colleagues conclude that many antioxidants reduce the risk of serious diseases, including diseases of the heart and certain cancers.
The researchers also found much higher levels of cadmium, a toxic metal, in regular crops.
Another criticism of the research is that the differences it found may be the result of different climates, different types of soil and different types of crops; they may not be the result of organic farming.
Browning said: This research supports what people think about organic food.
In other countries, there is much more support and acceptance of the bene ts of organic food and farming.
The canoe is our island, the crew is the community and the navigator is the leader, he says.
On a canoe, you are not just going from one place to another using the stars, the moon, the sun and the birds.
It is a partnership between the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Oceania Regional Of ce and  ve Paci c Island countries: Samoa, Tonga, New Zealand, the Cook Islands and Fiji.
The main aim of the 11,000km trip was to deliver a special message to the World Parks Congress.
According to the IUCN, in 2013, less than three per cent of the worlds oceans was in marine protected areas and less than one per cent of that is no take (no  shing).
And climate change is already having a serious effect on Paci c Islanders.
I work hard and am good at my job but, when PizzaExpress thinks it can take a percentage of our tips, I get upset.
Restaurant chains Ask and Zizzi also deduct 8% of the tips paid by card.
Cafe_ Rouge, Bella Italia and Belgo deduct 10%; Strada and Giraffe do, too.
Almost 6,000 people have signed Unites online petition.
He doesnt work for PizzaExpress but has worked for 11 years for another restaurant chain.
The way clouds affect global warming has been the biggest mystery in the study of future climate change.
4C would be catastrophic, not simply dangerous, Sherwood said.
For example, it would make life difficult, if not impossible, in much of the tropics and it would guarantee the eventual melting of the Greenland ice sheet and some of the Antarctic ice sheet.
When water evaporates from the oceans, the vapour can rise over nine miles to form rain clouds that reflect sunlight; or, it may rise just a few miles and fall slowly back down without forming clouds.
Climate sceptics like to criticize climate models because they are sometimes wrong, and we know that they are not perfect, said Sherwood.
But we are finding that the mistakes are being made by the models that predict less warming, not the models that predict more warming.
Even in successful countries such as Indonesia and Vietnam, the proportion was 20%.
His income has fallen slowly, because of his illness and his wifes illness, the cost of his sons marriage, the death of his father and loss of goods such as  shing nets.
Lovemore, from Zimbabwe, is now one of the poorest people in his village.
He recently lost his job because of ill health and has to look after his  ve grandchildren after the death of his daughters.
The second is education, from early childhood to the start of work, so people can escape and stay out of poverty.
Even Nigeria, with its oil wealth, spends only $650 per person, Shepherd said.
It is a beer brewed by women that anyone can drink, she says.
One weekend they created the recipe; the next weekend they brewed 1,600 litres.
This beer is not aimed at women, says Thomas Bingebo, the head brewer at Ocean.
Other breweries have already asked FemAle if they can brew new beers with them.
From all across Rwanda, and even from Burundi, people are coming to the southern town of Butare to a little shop called Inzozi Nziza (Sweet Dreams).
Here, at the central African countrys  rst ice-cream shop, customers can buy ice cream in sweet cream, passion fruit, strawberry and pineapple  avours.
Ice cream is important, she says between mouthfuls of honey- avoured ice cream.
The shop can certainly make dreams come true.
The shop is uniting people here, Kalisa Migendo, a 24-year-old student, says.
Inzozi Nziza was opened by Odile Gakire Katese.
Some are survivors of the 1994 genocide, when almost a million Tutsis and Hutus were killed.
When Im drumming, it gives me power because were still alive and survivors, she says.
Schools should teach navigation and map reading, he wrote.
We studied a group of current London taxi drivers and a group of retired London taxi drivers, said Dr Hugo Spiers of University College London, who is an author of the study.
The way we use navigation technology also has an impact on our own abilities, says Spiers.
McKinlay believes humans must still able to take control of their navigation.
La premiere chose quon regarde (The First Thing We Look At) by Gregoire Delacourt is the story of a French model who looks so similar to the American actor that the books main male character thinks she is Johansson.
In the novel, the models beauty means that men see her only as a sex object and women are jealous of her.
She has many adventures as Johansson and, in the end, dies in a car crash.
Delacourt is one of Frances best-loved authors; his last novel, My List of Desires, was translated into 47 languages and they are making a  lm of it.
I wrote a real love story about womens beauty, especially interior beauty.
I thought she might send me  owers because the book was a declaration of love for her, but she didnt understand, Delacourt said.       
All were tested between 2007 and 2010 on three different things: stamina, handgrip strength and lower-body power.
The results showed that a childs month of birth could make big differences to their levels of  tness, muscle strength and ability to accelerate, all of which predict how good someone is at sport.
Children born in October were almost as  t  they scored highest for strength and came third for power, with December children close behind.
The gap in physical ability between children in the same class but born in different months was sometimes very wide.
This is a huge physical advantage, said Sandercock.
These gaps could decide who became a top-level athlete because selection into elite sports may often depend on very small differences in a persons physical performance.
The  ndings seem to show that children born in the early months of the school year enjoy a double autumn advantage  we already know that they have an academic advantage and, now, they also seem to be better at sport, too.
Children that get a high-quality  rst experience will have greater agility, balance and coordination, and are more likely to develop an enjoyment of physical activity and be good at sport as they grow up, he said.
As soon as the children at a primary school in Stirling, Scotland, hear the words daily mile, they leave the classroom and start running around the school  eld.
For three-and-a-half years, all the pupils at St Ninians Primary School have walked or run a mile each day.
The thought of children across the country running every day because of something weve done is amazing.
Just in Stirling, 30 schools have already started or are going to start the daily mile.
The most important thing is that the children really enjoy it.
At St Ninians, teachers take their pupils out of lessons to the schools playing  eld for their daily mile at a time that suits that days timetable.
Researchers from Stirling University have begun a study to look for evidence of the physical, cognitive and emotional bene ts of the daily mile.
Paralympian, Tanni Grey-Thompson, chair of ukactive, a health organization for physical activity, said: All children need to achieve 60 active minutes every day  this can be in a lesson, on the walk to school or in the playground.
We know sitting still kills; not sitting still helps children build skills that will help them for the rest of their lives.
The Scottish government also supports the idea.
His team found meningitis at Times Square, a trace of anthrax on a train carriage and bacteria that cause plague on a rubbish bin and ticket machine at stations in uptown Manhattan.
All around the subway, there were bacteria from cheeses  brie, cheddar, parmesan and the mozzarella found on New York pizza.
The bacteria of Swiss cheese were found in midtown Manhattan and the  nancial district, and the bacteria used to make kimchi and sauerkraut showed up in the  nancial district and Bay Ridge.
Bacteria that cause diarrhoea and nausea, as well as E.coli, and the bacteria that can cause skin infections and urinary-tract infections were common all over the city.
He said he hoped the research would help health of cials to prevent and track diseases.       
The yes campaign had four big successes  it won 53% of the vote in Scotlands largest city, Glasgow, 57% in Dundee and 51% in North Lanarkshire.
We have heard the voice of Scotland and, now, we must hear the millions of voices of England, he said.
Ed Miliband, the leader of the Labour Party, said the referendum was a vote from the Scottish people for change.
We know our country needs to change.
Theyve not been a part of this for the last 18 years.
We will continue to  ght with the facts because the facts are on our side, he said.
There are already plans for a new shark exhibition in Orlando and an attraction in San Antonio that will allow customers to swim with dolphins.
SeaWorlds shares, which were worth $39 in 2013, fell to just under $18 in August 2015.    
Stratford was important to Shakespeare all his life, says Paul Edmondson, the head of learning and research at the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust.
But Stratford is where he bought land and houses, where he kept his library, where he lived and read and thought.
The anniversary of the death of the man from Stratford, the most famous and the most performed playwright in the world, will be celebrated across Britain and the world.
There will be performances of Macbeth in Singapore and Romeo and Juliet in Brussels.
In London, they are also creating a 37-screen pop-up cinema, one screen to show each of Shakespeares plays.
The National Theatre, the Royal Shakespeare Company and almost every other theatre production company in the country will celebrate the anniversary.
There will also be hundreds of lectures, international conferences,  lms, concerts, operas and major exhibitions.
Shakespeare was famous in his own lifetime but there is little documentary evidence about Shakespeares life and times.
The actor Mark Rylance has called the First Folio his favourite book in the world and most of the surviving First Folios will be on display  including those that belong to the British and Bodleian libraries, and a copy recently discovered in France.
The general public and many academics have underestimated the importance of Stratford to Shakespeare.
Hearing a salmons click is probably one of the most dif cult things a killer whale does.
It is harder to hear that click if theres a lot of noise around you.
The researchers used underwater microphones to measure the noise made by about 1,600 ships as they passed through Haro Strait, in Washington State, USA.
The two-year study recorded the sound made by 12 different types of ship, including cruise ships, container ships and military ships, that passed through the strait about 20 times a day.
Some ships are quieter than others but the average noise next to all the ships was 173 underwater decibels, the same as 111 decibels through the air  about the sound of a loud rock concert.
Whales are not usually right next to ships and so would hear noise of about 60 to 90 decibels  around the level of a vacuum cleaner.
Most noise is at that low frequency but there is more background noise in the high frequencies, too.
Reducing speed by six knots could decrease noise by half.
A quarter of women also pressed the shock button.
The report from psychologists at Virginia and Harvard Universities looks at the question of why most of us  nd it so hard to do nothing.
The only rules were that they had to stay sitting and not fall asleep.
Most of them did not enjoy the experience.
But 12 of 18 men gave themselves electric shocks and six of 24 women gave themselves electric shocks.
Imagine  a person is told to sit in a chair with wires attached to their skin and a button that will give them a harmless but uncomfortable shock, and they are told to just sit there with their thoughts, she said.
When you enter a department store, cameras are watching you.
We need to know what characteristics this shopper has and that, when those characteristics are present, this is what a person usually does.
If it sounds familiar, its because the internet has been using techniques like these for years.
If I just showed you a photo of someones body, you could probably tell me what gender they are.
We allow this to happen online so why not in shops?
In 6- to 7-year-olds, who have grown up with YouTube, Spotify music streaming and online television, the average DQ score was 98.
The biggest change is in time spent talking on the phone.
But, now, for children aged 12 to 15, phone calls make up just 3% of time spent communicating through any device.
For all adults, this rises to 20% and, for young adults, it is 9%.
When they are not using their phones, 12- to 15-year-olds have a very different relationship with other media, too.
They spend 20% of their time watching short video clips, for example on YouTube, or news clips on Facebook and other social sites.
The rest of their viewing time is spent watching DVDs, streamed content through Net ix or iTunes and recorded television programmes.         
From 2006 to 2008, Duran took out 68 loans from 39 banks in Spain.
He spent two months in prison; then, they let him out on 50,000 bail.
They collected more than 25,000 kilos of dead  sh afterwards and nearly 2,000 adult birds, chicks, eggs and nests were killed or destroyed.
It was Spains worst environmental disaster and the clean-up cost 90 million.
There are riches here, riches that the local inhabitants badly need, said energy spokesman Vicente Fernandez Guerrero.
People have mined metals here since Roman times.
They will use the best technology in the world here, Fernandez said.
